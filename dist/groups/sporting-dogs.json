  "description": "Active and alert, sporting dogs are the hunters of the dog world: the Pointers, Retrievers, Setters, and Spaniels.\nMany of them are multitaskers, but in general, Pointers find and silently point game; Retrievers bring back downed game from land or water; Setters find, point, and sometimes flush game out of hiding; and Spaniels find and flush game.\nSporting dogs have been bred to work closely with people and are highly trainable and generally friendly. These breeds enjoy long walks or runs and playing fetch. The water dogs among them can\u2019t get enough of swimming.\nSporting dogs have dense, water-repellent coats, which can be short, medium length, straight, curly, or wiry, to protect them in all types of brush and weather conditions. They love people and are well suited to being family dogs if given the necessary amount of exercise.",
