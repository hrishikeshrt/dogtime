  "description": "Terriers are the rascals of the dog world. Their name comes from the Latin word terra, meaning earth, and references their love of digging for such prey as foxes, moles, badgers, and rats.\nTerriers come in a wide range of sizes and shapes, but they all share a feisty, mischievous personality and an energetic nature. They\u2019re highly intelligent and trainable \u2014 if you have patience and a great sense of humor.\nIt\u2019s hard to stay a step ahead of a Terrier. True to their name, Terriers are territorial: they protect the patch of earth that\u2019s theirs and will bark furiously at people or animals who approach their property. They\u2019re also escape artists and require a securely fenced yard.\nMany Terriers have hard, wiry coats that must be plucked or stripped of dead hair to retain the proper texture; using clippers will soften and lighten the coat.",
