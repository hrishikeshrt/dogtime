  "description": "Every breed was created for a reason, and the companion dogs are no exception. Their job is to keep people company, perhaps the most important work a dog can do.\nSome are miniaturized versions of working dogs, and some were created solely as beautiful lap dogs \u2014 but without exception, they are all dog. The tiniest of them have no idea that they aren\u2019t as big or strong as other dogs, and they have the heart and courage of a Mastiff concealed in their small bodies.\nThat\u2019s an endearing quality, but it also means they need to be protected from themselves. Often they\u2019ll take on bigger dogs or even human intruders and can easily be injured or killed for their trouble.\nIn size they range from tiny four-pounders to sturdier 20- to 40-pounders. As a group, they\u2019re housedogs, unsuited to living outdoors. Their main goal in life is to be with their people, and they\u2019ll wilt if left to themselves for long hours day after day.",
