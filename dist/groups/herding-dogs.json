  "description": "The dogs in the herding group were developed to control large flocks of sheep or herds of cattle. They still retain that ability today, even though most of them never lay eyes on a Merino or Longhorn.\nEnergetic, smart, and serious, they\u2019re big proponents of family togetherness and like nothing better than to see the whole family in the same room so they can keep an eye on them.\nHerding breeds are protective of their people and property and make excellent watchdogs. They have a tendency to nip at or bump people \u2014 not because they\u2019re mean, but because that\u2019s how they\u2019re wired to herd.\nWith firm, consistent training, they can learn to behave in a more appropriate fashion. Their intelligence, agility, and activity level make them well suited to dog sports.",
