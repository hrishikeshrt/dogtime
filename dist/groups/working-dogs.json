  "description": "The diverse breeds represented in the working dog group were bred to perform a variety of tasks from guarding people, property, and livestock to pulling carts or sleds. In general, they\u2019re strong, smart, and fearless and can be fun-loving or serious.\nBecause of their size and strength, they require a structured home life and firm, fair, consistent training by someone who can provide leadership without resorting to anger or physical force.\nWith a couple of exceptions, such as the Alaskan Malamute and Siberian Husky \u2014 breeds too people-oriented to be guard dogs \u2014 they\u2019re protective. This protectiveness may become a problem if they don\u2019t have lots of positive human interaction and the right training.\nSome working dogs have smooth, easy-care coats, but many of them are Nordic or mountain breeds with lots of thick fur. Most of these dogs are considered moderately to highly active.",
