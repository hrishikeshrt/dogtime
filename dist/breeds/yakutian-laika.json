Although these are purebred and somewhat rare dogs, you may still find them in shelters and rescues. Remember to adopt, don\u2019t shop, whenever possible if the Yakutian Laika is the breed for you.\nThe fluffy and affectionate Yaikutian Laika makes an excellent family pet.

    "History": "There is evidence that the Yakutian Laika breed has existed for roughly 8,000 years. The breed comes from an area of Russia where people have found the remains of 40,000-year-old wolves, and many fans and researchers of the breed believe the Yakutian Laika may be related.Traditionally, the Sahka, the people of ancient Yakutia, trained the Yakutian Laika to be a sled dog. In the especially harsh winters of the region, the Sahka depended on sled dogs like the Yakutian Laika to transport goods and assist in hunting. They're often referred to as the original sled dog, as they were photographed as early as the 1600s pulling sleds.The Yakutian Laika wasn't just treated as a working dog, though. Over thousands of years, breeders worked to eliminate aggression towards humans, making them the ultimate companion dog as well. The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the breed in 2004, adding the Yakutian Laika to their Foundational Stock Service group.The friendly breed isn't known much outside of their native Russia, but their outgoing personality and stunning features are making them more and more popular around the world.",
    "Size": "Male Yakutian Laika stand roughly 21 to 23 inches from the shoulder and weigh 50 to 66 pounds. The female Yakutian Laika can be a little shorter, coming in at 20 to 22 inches from the shoulder, but also weighing 50 to 66 pounds.That said, many dogs can be larger or smaller than the average for their breed.",
    "Personality": "The Yakutian Laika breed has co-evolved with humans over thousands of years, so it's no wonder they are so affectionate and loyal to their people. Since being so close to humans is in their DNA, the Yakutian Laika will not thrive in a home where they have to be alone for long hours. The ancient breed loves to be in the thick of it, constantly interacting with their humans. This is why the Yakutian Laika makes such an amazing family dog.An intelligent breed, the Yakutian Laika is relatively easy to train. Positive reinforcement works best. Your Yakutian Laika might be stubborn or give you a hard time with training if they feel you aren't giving them the amount of attention they deserve. Scheduling play sessions before and after training can help with this.Yukatian Laikas are a medium-sized dog, and they can fare well in any abode as long as they have their own nook and plenty of play and cuddle time with you. Yard space is definitely a bonus, but again, the Yukatian Laika will want you out there playing with them! If you work from home or live in a home environment where at least one person is always around, this breed could be a great fit for you.",

Trim your dog's nails before they get too long -- usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Keep up with their oral health, too. You should brush their teeth daily. If your Yakutian Laika is not particularly fond of you brushing their teeth, you can ask your veterinarian for some tips on how to brush their teeth properly.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Yakutian Laika diet should be formulated for a medium-sized breed with high energy levels.  Keep your Yakutian Laika healthy and happy by measuring their food and feeding them twice a day instead of leaving food out all of the time.As with all dogs, the Yakutian Laika's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Yakutian Laika diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs -- including weight, energy, and health -- to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "The Yakutian Laika has a double coat, which is compromised of a soft, dense undercoat and a slightly coarse topcoat. Like other breeds with double coats, your Yakutian Laika will shed seasonally, also called \"blowing\" their coats.

    "Children And Other Pets": "Yakutian Laikas are super people-friendly, and that includes kids. The fluffy breed can be playful, but they are also somewhat reserved, so there is less chance of them accidentally knocking down a smaller child. Still, it is important to teach kids of all ages how to interact with your Yakutian Laika.As for other pets, the Yakutian Laika gets along well with other dogs, especially if they are reared together.
