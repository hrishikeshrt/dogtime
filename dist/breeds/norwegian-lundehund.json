  "description": {
    "": "Also known as the puffin dog, this unique and acrobatic canine was discovered on a remote island in Norway, where he was used to scale cliffs and rob puffin nests of their eggs. With six toes on each foot, including two large, functional dewclaws, and an exceptional range of motion in his joints, he can climb just about anywhere in your house or yard and squirm through the narrowest of passageways. Heck, you might even see one trying his paw at Half Dome someday.Cheerful, inquisitive, and mischievous, this is a dog who needs close supervision to keep him out of trouble. He's a primitive breed who's difficult to housetrain and loves to bark and dig, so keep that in mind before deciding that it would be really cool to have a dog who can bend his head backwards, splay his front legs out to the side, and close his ears to keep out moisture and dirt. Provide him with plenty of early socialization to prevent shyness and noise sensitivity. And if you're a bird lover, well, just keep in mind this breed's original purpose.",
    "Size": "The Norwegian Lundehund male stands 13.75 to 15 inches at the shoulder and weighs about 15.5 pounds. Females stand 12.5 to 13.75 inches and weigh around 13.25 pounds.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "A dense, rough outer coat is insulated by a soft undercoat in reddish-brown to fawn with black hair tips; black or gray with white markings; or white with dark markings. Norwegian Lundehunds shed heavily and need regular brushing with a firm bristle brush."
