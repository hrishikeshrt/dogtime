  "description": {
    "": "The Stabyhoun originated in the northeastern region of the Netherlands, where he was used as an all around hunting and watch dog. His name is believed to be derived from the Dutch words for \"stand by me dog.\"He's an excellent retriever, especially from water, so if you have a pool or live near a lake, he'll be in seventh heaven. Like most sporting breeds, he's friendly, tolerant, and willing to please. In addition to hunting, he enjoys participating in dog sports such as agility, flyball, and obedience.The Stabyhoun loves spending time with his people and is chummy with children and other pets. Begin training early to take advantage of his intelligence and desire to be with you.",
    "Size": "Ideally, males stand about 20.5 inches at the shoulder and weigh about 50 pounds. Females are slightly smaller, standing 19 inches at the shoulder and weighing about 45 pounds.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "The Stabyhoun's long, sleek coat comes in black, brown, and orange with white markings. Regular brushing will keep the coat tangle-free and minimize shedding. Unless your Stabyhoun's gotten into something particularly smelly, he doesn't need bathing; baths can ruin the sleekness of the coat."
