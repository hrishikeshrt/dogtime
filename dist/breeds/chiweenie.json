    "Highlights": "The most famous Chiweenie may be a dog named Tuna who has over 2 million followers on the Instagram account tunameltsmyheart.Chiweenies are a mixed breed dog. They are not \"purebreds\" like their Dachshund or Chihuahua parents.Even though they may be lap dog sized, Chiweenies have high energy and prefer to play.Chiweenie coats are usually short and good for allergy sufferers, though they can have long coats, too.The usual colors of Chiweenies are brown, black, and white. Their coats can be solid colors or a mix.The Chiweenie is especially easy to groom. The main concern, however, is maintaining good dental care.Chiweenies can be stubborn and may be particularly difficult to house train.These dogs tend to be \"yappy,\" though that also makes them great at being watchdogs.Chiweenies do best in one-person households or homes with smaller families and older children.Although designer breeders started creating Chiweenies in the late 1990s, you can find them at shelters or through rescue groups that cater to small dogs, Chihuahua mixes, or Dachshund mixes. Adopt! Don't shop!",
    "History": "The Chiweenie dog breed may have existed naturally over the years, but designer breeders started intentionally mixing Chihuahuas and Dachshunds in the late 1990s, likely in North America.Breeders wanted to mix the two parent breeds to minimize the back problems that tend to affect Dachshunds with their long bodies. They continued to create Chiweenies as demand for the mixed breed pups climbed.Even though the Chiweenie breed got its start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you.Check your local shelters, look up Chiweenie rescues, or check with breed-specific Dachshund or Chihuahua rescues, as they sometimes take in mixed breed dogs and find homes for them.",
    "Size": "As the Chiweenie is a relatively new mixed breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between Chihuahua and Dachshund parents, you can expect Chiweenies to be on the small side.Most weigh in at five to twelve pounds and range in height from six to ten inches at the shoulder. That said, many can be smaller or larger.",
    "Personality": "Many Chiweenie lovers describe these dogs' personalities as \"spunky.\" Although they are the size of your average lap dog, their high energy levels mean they'd probably prefer a game of fetch to a cuddle session.Some Chiweenies may have a prey drive, though most seem to have lost the hunting tendencies of their Dachshund parents. They do, however, love to bark. Some people might even go so far as to call them \"yappy.\" If you want a watchdog who will alert you to anyone who might approach your door, you can't do much better than the Chiweenie.These dogs do best with early training to curb any unwanted barking habits. They can be stubborn and difficult to house train, but for an energetic, consistent owner, their loyalty and desire to please will help training go a bit more smoothly.They also tend to latch on to one family member most of all, though they can get along with others in the house. Chiweenies may be best suited to a one-person home or smaller families, as they demand quite a bit of attention.",
    "Health": "The Chiweenie breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Chihuahua and Dachshund also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Chiweenies suffer from include:Hypoglycemia: You may know this as low blood sugar. This is due to the Chiweenie's small stomach and is a problem they share with their Chihuahua parents.Diabetes: Often the next condition to develop after hypoglycemia. Discuss this with your veterinarian. Dogs with diabetes require lifelong treatment.Degenerative disc disease: This condition causes issues with the spine and can lead to serious injuries or paralysis. Dachshunds also suffer from this problem. It is important to limit activities that will be strenuous on the spine. Jumping or climbing aren't the safest exercises for these dogs.Dental issues: This is a common problem among small dog breeds. Maintain good oral hygiene and a proper diet, and get regular professional teeth cleanings to prevent these issues.Hypothyroidism: An under-active thyroid. Your veterinarian can determine if your dog suffers from this issue and prescribe treatment.Knee and joint issues: This is a common problem among many breeds, especially as dogs age.Allergies: Seasonal and skin allergies can cause your dog a lot of discomfort. Talk to your veterinarian if you see excessive sneezing, chewing or licking of the skin, coughing, difficulty breathing, rashes, or other signs of allergic reactions.",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Chiweenie's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Chiweenies are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Chiweenie's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as small breeds are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Chiweenie diet should be formulated for a small breed with high energy. They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their amount of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the Chiweenie's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Chiweenie's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Chiweenie coats are often a mix of their Dachshund and Chihuahua parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Chiweenies are brown, black, and white. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colors.They usually have short coats, and they're generally considered to be a good choice for allergy sufferers. There are longer-coated Chiweenies, too, though they may not be as allergy friendly. Luckily, both coats are very easy to groom. A good brushing per week will probably do.Because they tend to have shorter coats, Chiweenies aren't particularly suited for extreme weather. You'll likely need a coat in the winter for your dog, and you may need to apply sunscreen to the ears, nose, and sensitive areas where there's less fur coverage in the summer months.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Because the Chiweenie is a small dog, they can be easily injured by overly excited children. Chiweenies prefer to be mostly around adults or older kids who know how to play gently. That said, for children who learn early how to properly approach and play with a small dog, the Chiweenie can make a great, active companion.When it comes to other pets, Chiweenies can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. It's best if they get used to other pets early. That said, Chiweenies aren't naturally fond of other animals and may prefer to be the solo pet in the household.Still, many Chiweenies get along just fine with other dogs and cats, so it really comes down to training, socialization, and the luck of the draw.",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Chiweenies because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Chihuahua or Dachshund breed-specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:Chihuahua Rescue & Transport (CRT)Little Paws Dachshund RescueYou can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!"
