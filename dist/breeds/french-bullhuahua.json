    "Highlights": "The French Bullhuahua is a mixed breed dog. They are not purebreds like their French Bulldog or Chihuahua parents.The main colors of French Bullhuahuas are golden, brown, white, brown, black, brindle, merle, cream, and tan. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colors.French Bullhuahuas are generally considered to be a good choice for allergy sufferers. Their coats are very easy to groom. A good brushing per week will probably do.French Bullhuahuas have medium-to-high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.French Bullhuahua dogs prefer to be mostly around adults or older kids who know how to play gently.French Bullhuahuas aren't naturally fond of other animals and may prefer to be the solo pet in the household. Early socialization, however, can help them get along with other pets just fine.French Bullhuahuas can be a bit stubborn and take to house-training slowly, but for a consistent owner, their loyalty and desire to please will help training go a bit more smoothly.",
    "History": "The French Bullhuahua mixed dog breed may have existed naturally over the years, but designer breeders started intentionally mixing Chihuahuas and French Bulldogs in the 2000s, likely in North America. Breeders wanted to mix the two adorable parent breeds to help minimize the breathing problems of the French Bulldog with their brachycephalic (short and smushed) faces. They continued to create French Bullhuahuas as demand for the mixed breed pups climbed.Even though the French Bullhuahua mixed breed got its start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you. Check your local shelters, look up rescues in your area, or check with breed specific French Bulldog or Chihuahua rescues, as they sometimes take in mixed breed dogs and find homes for them.",
    "Size": "As the French Bullhuahua is a relatively new breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between Chihuahua and French Bulldog parents, you can expect French Bullhuahuas to be on the small side.Most weigh in at ten to 30 pounds and stand anywhere from six to twelve inches from the shoulder. However, many can be smaller or larger than average.",
    "Personality": "If there was ever a spunky mixed breed dog, it is the French Bullhuahua. Even though the Mexican Frenchie is a small dog, they tend to think they're anything but! They can be high energy, but they're just as likely to enjoy a nice cuddle session on the couch while you watch TV--or beg you to play with them during your shows.As smaller dogs, French Bullhuahuas feel the need to protect their humans and tend to be a bit yappy. This lap dog loves to let their humans know about door knocks or unexpected noises from the TV. If you want a watchdog who will alert you to anyone who might approach your door, you can't do much better than the French Bullhuahua.These dogs do best with early training to curb any unwanted barking habits. They can be a bit stubborn and take to house-training slowly, but for a consistent owner, their loyalty and desire to please will help training go a bit more smoothly.As small pups, French Bullhuahuas tend to latch on to one family member most of all, though they can get along with others in the house. French Bullhuahuas may be best suited to a one-person home or smaller families, as they demand quite a bit of attention.",
    "Health": "The French Bullhuahua mixed breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Chihuahua and French Bulldog also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems the French Bullhuahua suffers from include:Intervertebral Disc Hip DysplasiaPulmonic StenosisDegenerationBreathing issues related to brachycephalic faces, like heat stroke.",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your French Bullhuahua's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Like their parent breeds, French Bullhuahuas are prone to weight gain, and they have medium-to-high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your French Bullhuahua's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as small breeds are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal French Bullhuahua diet should be formulated for a small dog breed with medium-to-high energy. They have a tendency to gain weight if they're overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their amount of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the French Bullhuahua's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your French Bullhuahua's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "French Bullhuahua coats are often a mix of their French Bulldog and Chihuahua parents' coats and colors. The main colors of French Bullhuahuas are golden, brown, white, brown, black, brindle, merle, cream, and tan. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colors.They usually have short coats, and they're generally considered to be a good choice for allergy sufferers. There are longer-coated French Bullhuahuas, too, though they may not be as allergy friendly. Luckily, both coats are very easy to groom. A good brushing per week will probably do.Because they tend to have shorter coats, French Bullhuahuas aren't particularly suited for extreme weather. You'll likely need a coat in the winter for your dog, and you may need to apply dog sunscreen to the ears, nose, and sensitive areas where there's less fur coverage in the summer months.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Since the French Bullhuahua is a small dog, they can be easily injured by overly excited children. French Bullhuahua dogs prefer to be mostly around adults or older kids who know how to play gently. That said, for children who learn early how to properly approach and play with a small dog, the French Bullhuahua can make a great, active companion.When it comes to other pets, French Bullhuahuas can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. It's best if they get used to other pets early. That said, French Bullhuahuas aren't naturally fond of other animals and may prefer to be the solo pet in the household.Still, many French Bullhuahuas get along just fine with other dogs and cats, so it really comes down to training, socialization, and the luck of the draw.",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed specific rescue for French Bullhuahuas because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try French Bulldog or Chihuahua breed specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:French Bulldog Rescue NetworkAffenpinscher Rescue of AmericaYou can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!"
