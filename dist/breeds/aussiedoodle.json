  "intro": "The Aussiedoodle is a mixed breed dog \u2014 a cross between the Australian Shepherd and Poodle dog breeds. Incredibly smart, playful, and loyal, these pups inherited some of the best qualities from both of their parents.\nAussiedoodles go by several names, including Aussiepoo and Aussiepoodle. Despite their unfortunate status as a designer breed, you may find these mixed breed dogs in shelters and rescues. So please remember to adopt! Don\u2019t shop!\nThese active dogs, often referred to as an \u201cEinstein\u201d breed for their smarts, do well in homes that can provide plenty of attention and exercise. The Aussiedoodle makes an excellent family dog, as long as smaller children know how to safely play with the pup. They are also incredible therapy dogs, given how quickly they bond to a specific human or two.\nSee below for all mixed dog breed traits and facts about Aussiedoodles!",
  "description": {
    "Highlights": "Aussiedoodles are mixed breed dogs. They are not purebreds like their Australian Shepherd or Poodle parents.Many Aussiedoodle owners claim that they are hypoallergenic dogs and may be better for allergy sufferers, though no dog is completely hypoallergenic.Aussiedoodles are smart dogs and require mental stimulation. If they become bored, they may act out in destructive ways.Their coats can be a variety of colors typically seen in Australian Shepherds, like blue merle, red merle, black and red tri, black and tan (AKA \"phantom\"), parti, sable, or even a solid color in rare cases.Some Aussiedoodles have wavier coats, while others have tighter curls like their Poodle parents. Aussiedoodles with shorter hair may be better for allergy sufferers, but it is not a guarantee.",
    "History": "The Aussiedoodle mixed dog breed may have existed naturally over the years, but designer breeders started intentionally mixing Australian Shepherds and Poodles in the late 1990s or early 2000s, likely in North America.It makes sense why the Aussiedoodle started booming in popularity, given how smart, playful, and cute the Poodle and the Australian Shepherd are. The breed is sometimes touted as a hypoallergenic dog option for those who suffer from allergies, but the truth is no dog is completely hypoallergenic.Even though the Aussiedoodle mixed breed got its start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you.Check your local shelters, look up Aussiedoodle rescues, or check with breed-specific Australian Shepherd or Poodle rescues, as they sometimes take in mixed breed dogs and find homes for them.",
    "Size": "As the Aussiedoodle is a relatively new breed--and there are size variations ranging from toy to standard for the Poodle--there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between Poodle and Australian Shepherd parents, you can expect Aussiepoodles to range in size from a small-to-medium size.Most weigh in at 25 to 70 pounds and range in height from 10 to 15 inches at the shoulder. That said, many can be smaller or larger.",
    "Personality": "Many Aussiedoodle enthusiasts describe these dogs' personalities as goofy and loving. No matter their size, whether they are a smaller Aussiedoodle from a Toy Poodle or a larger Aussiedoodle from a Standard Poodle, you can expect this dog to have a lot of energy. You can keep your Aussiedoodle occupied with long hikes, walks, beach days, or retrieval games.Australian Shepherds are herding dogs, so your Aussiedoodle may try to round you, kids, or other things up! They are also incredibly smart, thanks to both their Australian Shepherd and Poodle parents, so your Aussiedoodle will require a lot of mental stimulation. If bored, Aussiedoodles can easily become destructive.Aussiedoodles also love to be around their humans. Like the Australian Shepherd, Aussiedoodles will sometimes get closer and stick with one or two of their favorite humans. This isn't to say that they don't get along with multiple people or larger families, though!",
    "Health": "The Aussiedoodle breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Australian Shepherd and Poodle also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the most common health ailments Aussiedoodles suffer from include:Hip dysplasiaProgressive retinal atrophyIvermectin sensitivity (reactions to flea and tick medications)Cataracts",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Aussiedoodle's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Aussiedoodles are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking loudly against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.If you have a smaller Aussiedoodle, one of your main concerns with their care will be keeping their oral hygiene up. Of course, you should brush your dog's teeth no matter the size, but smaller dogs with smaller mouths are more prone to dental and gum diseases. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Aussiedoodle diet should be formulated for a small- to medium-sized breed with high energy.Like both of their parent breeds, the Aussiedoodle has a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Treats should be limited, as well.As with all dogs, the Aussiedoodle's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Aussiedoodle's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Aussiedoodles coats are often a mix of their Australian Shepherd and Poodle parents. Their coat can be a variety of colors typically seen in Australian Shepherds, like blue merle, red merle, black and red tri, black and tan (AKA \"phantom\"), parti, sable, or even a solid color in rare cases.The Aussiedoodle coat can also be a variety of textures, depending on the puppy's parents. Some have wavier coats, while others have tighter curls like their Poodle parents. Aussiedoodles with shorter hair may be better for allergy sufferers, but it is not a guarantee.Given their variety of coats, it depends on the individual Aussiedoodle when it comes to how they tolerate extreme weather. In general, they are able to handle colder temperatures better than say, a Chihuahua, but you should always be sure to practice caution and bundle up during the colder winter months.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Due to their spunky and smart nature, Aussiedoodles need a lot of play time and exercise, which is what makes them such great family dogs. Still, it is important to teach any children who may be playing with your Aussiedoodle how to safely interact with the dog.When it comes to other pets, Aussiedoodles can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. It's best if they get used to other pets early. If there are smaller animals, your Aussiedoodle may even try to herd them!Aussiedoodles can get along just fine with other dogs and cats, so it really comes down to training, socialization, and the luck of the draw.",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Aussiedoodles because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Australian Shepherd or Poodle breed-specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:Aussie And Me Animal RescueCarolina Poodle RescueYou can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!"
