  "description": {
    "": "The Norwegian Buhund hails from Norway, where he was responsible for herding livestock and guarding the farm. He has a trait that's rare among the Spitz breeds: a desire to please. Add in his intelligence and independence, and you get a highly trainable and capable dog. He can handle jobs ranging from hearing dog, to police dog, to competitor in agility and obedience trials. His alert nature and tendency to bark make him a good watchdog, although he's probably too friendly to pose any real threat.This is an active \u2014 some say tireless \u2014 breed who needs a lot of vigorous exercise and playtime daily. He's highly affectionate with his family, including the kids, and enjoys a cuddle on the couch as well as a romp in the park. Kind, consistent training is essential for this smart dog, as is family involvement. He won't want to be left out of anything!",
    "Size": "The Norwegian Buhund is just short of medium-sized. Males stand 17 to 18.5 inches at the shoulder and weigh 31 to 40 pounds; females stand 16 to 17.5 inches and weigh 26 to 35 pounds.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "The Norwegian Buhund has a soft, dense undercoat topped by a thick, hard outer coat. It comes in wheaten \u2014 pale cream to bright orange, with or without dark-tipped hairs and as little white as possible \u2014 or black, with as little white as possible. The coat on the head and front of the legs is shorter than on the rest of the body.His coat is fairly easy to care for, needing only a good brushing several times a week. During shedding seasons, daily brushing sessions are a good idea."
