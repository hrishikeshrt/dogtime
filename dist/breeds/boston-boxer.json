    "Highlights": "Boston Boxers are mixed breed dogs. They are not purebreds like their Boston Terrier or Boxer parents.The main colors of Boston Boxers are black, brown, fawn, blue, and white. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colors, like in a pied or brindle pattern.They usually have short coats, and they're generally considered to be a good choice for allergy sufferers. A weekly brushing with regular bathing should keep your Boston Boxer's coat shiny and healthy.Boston Boxers are known to be a good choice for families with children. It's important that children learn how to properly approach and play with a small- to medium-sized dog. Always supervise playtime.The Boston Boxer is a highly energetic mixed breed. If left alone for too long or without any sort of stimulation, this energy can manifest in unwanted destructive behaviors.Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.When it comes to other pets, Boston Boxers can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly.",
    "History": "The Boston Boxer mixed dog breed may have existed naturally over the years, but designer breeders started intentionally mixing Boston Terriers and Boxers in the late 1990s, likely in North America.Breeders wanted to mix the two parent breeds to keep the friendly and energetic spirit of the Boxer but in a smaller, Boston Terrier size. They continued to create Boston Boxers as demand for the mixed breed pups climbed.Even though the Boston Boxer got their start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide the Boston Boxer is the dog for you. Be sure to check your local shelters, look up Boston Boxer or Miniature Boxer rescues, or check with breed-specific Boxer or Boston Terrier rescues, as they sometimes take in mixed breed dogs and find homes for them.",
    "Size": "Since the Boston Boxer is a relatively new mixed breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between Boston Terrier and Boxer parents, you can expect your Boston Boxer to be on the small-to-medium size.Most weigh in at 22 to 55 pounds and range in height from 15 to 23 inches from the shoulder. However, many can be larger or smaller than average.Checking in with the parents' sizes can also help you gauge the adult size of your Boston Boxer puppy.",
    "Personality": "Many fans of the Boston Boxer describe their dogs as fun-loving and loyal. The Mini Boxer can be somewhat hesitant around strangers, which is why it is very important to socialize your Boston Boxer as early as possible to make sure they are people-friendly.These dogs are prone to attaching to one particular family member, and they can become somewhat protective of them. If you're looking for a diligent watchdog, the Boston Boxer will gladly take the job.Even with their protective tendencies, most Boston Boxer enthusiasts say their dogs are complete goofballs. The Mini Boxer loves to clown around and entertain, so don't be surprised if yours resorts to hammy acts to grab your attention.The Boston Boxer is also a highly energetic mixed breed, so they are best-suited with people who can keep up with the pace. If left alone for too long or without any sort of stimulation, this energy can manifest in unwanted destructive behaviors.",
    "Health": "The Boston Boxer breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Boxer and Boston Terrier also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it's important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Boston Boxer suffer from include:heart murmurshypothyroidismcataractsdilated cardiomyopathy",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Boston Boxer's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Like most dogs, Boston Boxers are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in. This will also help prevent unwanted destructive boredom habits.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.You should brush their teeth daily. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly. This holds especially true if your Boston Boxer is smaller, as small breeds are prone to dental issues.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Boston Boxer diet should be formulated for a small- to medium-sized breed with high energy. They are prone to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Be sure to limit their amount of treats, too.As with all dogs, the Boston Boxer's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Boston Boxer's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Boston Boxer coats are often a mix of their Boston Terrier and Boxer parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Boston Boxers are black, brown, fawn, blue, and white. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colors, like in a pied or brindle pattern.They usually have short coats, and they're generally considered to be a good choice for allergy sufferers. The Boston Boxer's coat is relatively easy to groom. A good weekly brushing along with regular bathing should keep your Boston Boxer's coat shiny and healthy.Since they tend to have shorter coats, Boston Boxers aren't particularly suited for extreme weather. You'll likely need a coat in the winter for your dog, and you may need to apply sunscreen to the ears, nose, and sensitive areas where there's less fur coverage in the summer months.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Since the Boston Boxer has such a range in terms of size, smaller Boston Boxers, affectionately known as Mini Boxers, can be easily injured by overly excited children.Still, the Boston Boxer is an affectionate and fun-loving breed, so they are known to be a good choice for families with children. It is important that any children interacting with your Boston Boxer learn how to properly approach and play with a small- to medium-sized dog.When it comes to other pets, Boston Boxers can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. It's best if they get used to other pets early. Again, thanks to their playful personality, they do tend to get along with other animals, as long as they are introduced in a calm and controlled setting. It really comes down to training, socialization, and the luck of the draw.",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed specific rescue for Boston Boxers because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Boston Terrier or Boxer breed specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:Green Acres Boxer RescueMidAmerica Boston Terrier Rescue Inc.You can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!"
