    "Highlights": "Westiepoos are mixed breed dogs. They are not purebreds like their Poodle or West Highland White Terrier parents.The most common colors of coat for a Westiepoo are white or cream and sometimes black or tan.The Westiepoo is a low maintenance canine and doesn't shed much; although, you'll still need to undertake brushing sessions from time to time to lower the chances of any mats taking form.The mixed breed's high prey drive can be an issue with smaller animals. Introduce your Westiepoo to any other pets and set boundaries right from the start; although, the breed might not be a good fit for a cat-friendly household.The Westiepoo's intelligence means that interactive toys are a must, especially to ward off any destructive behavior, which might be amplified by the dog being left alone for too long.The Westiepoo is an excellent mix of a super loving and very active dog. If you're lounging around at home on a lazy afternoon or relaxed evening, the breed will want to snuggle up and hang out with you.",
    "History": "The Westiepoo is one of the newest mixed dog breeds around, so there's not too much available in the way of accurate information about its history.Focusing on the dog's parent breeds, the West Highland White Terrier comes from Scotland where they were developed to hunt down and catch various types of small vermin. The dog's white coat is rumored to have become standard for the breed after a hunting mishap that involved mistaking a dog for a fox!When it comes to the Poodle, the breed goes right back to ancient Egypt, but they became popular in France as a duck hunting dog.The Westiepoo has become known as a designer dog breed, but many of them unfortunately end up in shelters. So consider contacting your local rescue groups and shelters if you're thinking about adding the Westiepoo to your home.",
    "Size": "The Westiepoo is usually described as a small dog. Although, as is always the case with newer mixed dog breeds, exact size standards might vary.Most weigh in at 20 to 35 pounds and range in height from eleven to 17 inches.",
    "Personality": "The Westiepoo is an excellent mix of a super loving and very active dog. If you're lounging around at home on a lazy afternoon or relaxed evening, the breed will want to snuggle up and hang out with you. This goes for being around children, too.But the mixed breed's exercise needs and smart nature also mean that you'll want to make sure there are always activities and toys for them to play with. Walks should be on the brisk side, and ideally include safe off-leash sessions. The Westiepoo's intelligence means that interactive toys are a must, especially to ward off any destructive behavior, which might be amplified by the dog being left alone for too long.Reward-based training is also key to prevent any stubborn streaks developing. While the Westiepoo is generally a friendly dog, they do have a hunting heritage and are not usually recommended as a good fit for households that already have existing small pets.",
    "Health": "Westiepoos are generally considered to be healthy dogs; although, the breed can be predisposed to some of the same conditions that the West Highland White Terrier and Poodle face. As always, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your dog's vet.Some of the more common health problems Westiepoos suffer from include:EpilepsyAtrophyHip DysplasiaTooth loss",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, it's important to keep up your Westiepoo's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Physical and mental stimulation is vital for a Westiepoo's health and happiness. You'll want to aim for at least 45 minutes of outdoor exercise every day. Ideally, you'll have access to an off-leash park or safe fenced-in yard where the breed can dash and dart around. Interactive smart toys are also a must--this is a dog who needs to be challenged and will delight in completing agility and obedience tests.If you can, try and brush your Westiepoo's teeth every day because small dogs can be more prone to dental issues. Also be sure to look at the breed's ears around once a week to check for any signs of possible inflammation or infection. Your Westiepoo's nails should be clipped every month. Speak to your vet if you need guidance in how to carry out the process.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Westiepoo diet should be formulated for a small breed with high energy.Westiepoos need to stick to a healthy diet, as overeating can cause weight gain and associated health problems, especially if adequate exercise isn't offered.As with all dogs, the Westiepoo's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Westiepoo's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "The most common colors of coat for a Westiepoo are white or cream and sometimes black or tan.The Westiepoo's coat is medium length and density, and usually described as being wavy to the touch. The dog is a low maintenance canine and doesn't shed much; although, you'll still need to undertake brushing sessions from time to time to lower the chances of any mats taking form.In general, the Westiepoo is an adaptable dog when it comes to climate. Just make sure to provide a suitable dog coat if the weather gets too frosty and your canine seems cold, especially if you've clipped their hair. Also, during hotter months, make sure shade and fresh water are always available during outdoor play and activity sessions.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "The Westiepoo usually does well around children, especially older ones who have learned to respect the dog's boundaries. Strong bonds between canine and kids can be formed if early training and socialization is carried out correctly.When it comes to existing household pets, the mixed breed's high prey drive can definitely be an issue, especially with smaller animals. Make sure to properly introduce your Westiepoo to any other pets and set boundaries right from the start; although, the mixed breed might not be a good fit for a cat-friendly household.Ultimately, early socialization really pays off with this mixed breed. Make sure to reward your Westiepoo for good behavior and adhere to a proper training regime when you bring them home to your family.",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Westiepoos because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try West Highland White Terrier or Poodle breed-specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:Westie Rescue, Inc.Carolina Poodle RescueYou can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!"
