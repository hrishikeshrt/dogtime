  "description": {
    "Highlights": "Pugaliers are mixed breed dogs. They are not purebreds like their Pug or Cavalier King Charles Spaniel parents.The main colors of Pugaliers are apricot, black, brown, ruby, gray, white, black & tan, and tricolor. Sometimes their coats are solid, but usually they're a combination of these colors.For grooming, a good brushing per week will probably do, though if their coats are more like their Cavalier parent, they may need two to three brushes per week.If your pup inherits the folds in their skin from the pug parents, make sure to keep the skin clean and dry, as they are prone to developing skin infections.Pugaliers are prone to weight gain, and they have moderate energy levels. Make sure your pup gets several potty breaks through the day with active play sessions and short walks mixed in.Because the Pugalier is on the small side, they can be easily injured by overly excited children. Pugaliers are great for families of all ages of kids, just supervise and make sure everyone knows how to play gently.",
    "History": "The Pugalier mixed dog breed may have existed naturally over the years, but designer breeders started intentionally mixing Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and Pugs in the 1990s, likely in North America.Even though the Pugalier breed got their start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the dog for you.Check your local shelters, look up Pugalier rescues, or check with breed-specific Pug or King Charles Spaniel rescues, as they sometimes take in mixed breed dogs.The Pugalier is recognized by:American Canine Hybrid Club (ACHC)Designer Dogs Kennel Club (DDKC)Dog Registry of America, Inc. (DRA)International Designer Canine Registry (IDCR)",
    "Size": "The Pugalier is a relatively new mixed breed, so there are few standards when it comes to size. As a mix between King Charles Spaniel and Pug parents, you can expect Pugaliers to be on the small side.Most weigh in at ten to 20 pounds and range in height from ten to 14 inches at the shoulder. That said, many can be smaller or larger depending on which parents genes are more dominant.",
    "Personality": "Many Pugalier lovers describe these dogs' personalities as charming, good-natured, and friendly. These people-pleasing pups, love to make you happy. Their friendly nature makes them an excellent addition to multiple pet homes.While they love to make you happy, they can also be a bit stubborn. Positive enforcement is strongly recommended with these pups. For a patient, consistent owner, the dog's loyalty and desire to please will help training go a bit more smoothly.Tip: If your Pugalier is being stubborn when it comes to potty training, frequent pee breaks are recommended.If you're looking for a playful, friendly, companion dog, you can't do much better than the Pugalier.",
    "Health": "The Pugalier mixed breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and Pug also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Pugaliers suffer from include:Hip DysplasiaHeart ConditionsPatellar LuxationDry Eye",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Pugalier's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Pugaliers are prone to weight gain, and they have moderate energy levels. Make sure your pup gets several potty breaks through the day with active play sessions and short walks mixed in.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this. If your pup inherits the folds in their skin from the pug parents, make sure to keep the skin clean and dry, as they are prone to developing skin infections.Your main concern when it comes to your Pugalier's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as small breeds are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly, and YouTube can help with teeth brushing and nail trimming tutorials.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Pugalier diet should be formulated for a small breed with a moderate energy level. They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day.As with all dogs, the Pugalier's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Pugalier's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Pugalier coats are often a mix of their Pug and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Pugaliers are apricot, black, brown, ruby, gray, white, black & tan, and tricolor. Sometimes their coats are solid, but usually they're a combination of these colors.They typically have medium length, coats, and they're generally pretty easy to groom. A good brushing per week will probably do, though if their coats are more like their Cavalier parent, they may need two to three brushes per week. Baths should be sparse as they need their natural oils for optimum radiance.Because they tend to have shorter coats, Pugaliers aren't particularly suited for extreme weather. You'll likely need a coat in the winter for your dog, and you may need to apply sunscreen to the ears, nose, and sensitive areas where there's less fur coverage in the summer months.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Because the Pugalier is on the small side, they can be easily injured by overly excited children. Pugaliers are great for families of all ages of kids, just supervise and make sure everyone knows how to play gently.When it comes to other pets, Pugaliers get along well with most animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly.Always be cautious introducing new dogs to each other. While Pugaliers are very friendly, some dogs are not. Dogs should always be separated during meal times.For more insight on this breed it's best to read about their parents the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and Pug.",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Pugaliers because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Pug or Cavalier King Charles Spaniel breed specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:Cavalier Alliance for Rescue, Research, and Education, Inc.Compassionate Pug RescueYou can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!"
