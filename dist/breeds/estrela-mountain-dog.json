    "History": "The Estrela Mountain Dog is called the Cao da Serra da Estrela in Portuguese and were herd-guarding dogs in the Serra da Estrela, which is now Portugal. While their exact origins are unknown, they are one of the oldest dog breeds in the Estrela Mountains region.It took almost a hundred years of breeding the best guardian-herding dogs to produce what is today's Estrela Mountain Dog.In the early 1900s, the standard for the Estrela Mountain Dog breed was developed. Shepherds in Portugal depended on their ability to identify and scare off wolves and other large predators. These pups are brave and intelligent, which made them perfect guardian herding dogs.Shepherds and farmers were the main breeders of Estrela Mountain Dogs before World War II. However, greater interest in the breed returned by the 1950s. Special annual shows called concursos were reinstated to encourage the people of Serra da Estrela to stick to official breed standards.",
    "Size": "As the Estrela Mountain Dog is an ancient breed in Portugal, there are some standards when it comes to their size. As a purebred guardian-herding dog, you can expect the Estrela Mountain Dog to be on the large side.Most weigh in at 75 to 130 pounds and range in height from 24 to 30 inches at the shoulder. That said, many can be smaller or larger than normal.",
    "Personality": "The Estrela Mountain Dog is a very protective and family-oriented pooch. These are large dogs who like to be around their pet parents or family and are natural guardians.Because of their calm temperament, they can stay inside and cuddle all day with you. They are not very agile but are very brave and able to defend against predators larger than themselves.These dogs have a barking tendency if they feel if something amiss is going on outside the home and will have no problem alerting their pet parents of any sign of trouble. They are highly intelligent but need a strong and confident owner to train them and socialize them early to be able to get along with other dogs.Estrela Mountain Dogs are easy to train and are willing to please their owners. They are best as watchdogs and guardians and have a natural instinct to protect their family and small children.If you want a loyal and loving dog who is best suited for larger homes with yards, then the Estrela Mountain Dog is the right dog for you!",
    "Health": "The Estrela Mountain Dog might be predisposed to the same conditions that most large herding dogs might also face.

    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Estrela Mountain Dog's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Estrela Mountain Dogs are prone to weight gain, and they have medium energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long\u2014usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor.

You should brush their teeth as recommended by your vet, as many dogs are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Estrela Mountain Dog diet should be formulated for a large breed with medium energy. These pups have a tendency to gain weight if overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their number of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the Estrela Mountain Dog's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Estrela Mountain Dog's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs\u2014including weight, energy, and health\u2014to make a specific recommendation.",

A good brushing at least once a week is needed for grooming.Because they tend to have longer coats, the Estrela Mountain Dog can handle colder weather, as they were bred to be herding dogs in the mountains of Portugal.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Because the Estrela Mountain Dog is a large purebred, they can easily handle the play of overly excited children.
