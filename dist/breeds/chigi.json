  "intro": "The Chigi is a mixed breed dog \u2014 a cross between the Chihuahua and Corgi dog breeds. While they may be small, they\u2019re very alert, affectionate, and playful. These pups inherited some of the best qualities from both of their parents.\nChigis go by a few names, including Chi-Corgi, Chorgie, and Chihuahua/Corgi. Despite their unfortunate status as a designer breed, you can find these mixed breed dogs, along with many more, in shelters and breed specific rescues, so remember to adopt! Don\u2019t shop!\nThe Chigi makes for a wonderful addition to almost any family; although, they\u2019re not recommended for small, excitable children, as they could injure this little pup. This tiny dog is considered to be toy sized, so extra care may be required. They\u2019re playful and affectionate and would fit right in to a big family with older kids or in an active single-person home.\nWith proper exercise a Chigi could live in an apartment, though they prefer a big home with an open yard to run around in. If you are looking for a small pup with a big personality, this could be your next fur baby.\nSee below for all Chigi facts and mixed dog breed characteristics!",

Make sure your dog gets a few walks per day with several good, active play sessions mixed in.Chigis can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly. They're not recommended for dog parks because they could roam and try to herd other dogs.When it comes to training, positive reinforcement is the way to go with these pups.

    "History": "The Chigi mixed dog breed is much newer than their Chihuahua and Corgi parents. While Chihuahuas are believed to have originated in Mexico, the Corgi, in contrast, was a herding dog all the way from cattle farms in Wales.While Chigis may have existed naturally over the years, designer breeders started intentionally mixing Chihuahuas and Corgis in the 1990s, likely in North America.Even though the Chigi mixed breed got their start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the mixed breed for you.Check your local shelters, look up Chigi rescues, or check with breed specific Corgi or Chihuahua rescues, as they often will take in mixed breed dogs.For more information about the parent breed history read more about the Chihuahua history and Pembroke Welsh Corgi history.The Chigi has been recognized by:Dog Registry of America, Inc. (DRA)American Canine Hybrid Club (ACHC)Designer Breed Registry (DBR)Designer Dogs Kennel Club (DDKC)International Designer Canine Registry (IDCR)",
    "Size": "The Chigi is a relatively new mixed breed, so there are few standards when it comes to size. As a mix between Chihuahua and Corgi parents, you can expect Chigis to be in the Toy family.Most weigh in at ten to 20 pounds and range in height from seven to twelve inches at the shoulder. That said, many can be smaller or larger depending on which parent's genes are more dominant.Males run slightly larger than females.",
    "Personality": "Many Chigi lovers describe these dogs' personalities as affectionate and alert. They're the size of your average toy pup with lively personalities. They are fun, playful, and devoted to their humans.Chigis may have herding tendencies from their Corgi parent, and they may consider small children as part of their flock. So make sure that you train and socialize your dog early.When it comes to training, positive reinforcement is the way to go with these pups. They can be willful but are highly trainable, so make sure they feel inclined to be so!Chigis enjoy walks and thrive on active play sessions. If you like walking, you'd better not leave this one behind. The Chigi will love being included in daily activities.Apartments are just fine for these tiny pups as long as they get adequate exercise; though, they prefer a home with a big yard to run free.",
    "Health": "The Chigi mixed breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Chihuahua and Pembroke Welsh Corgi also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Chigis suffer from include:Eye problemsPatellar luxationJoint issuesHypoglycemiaEpilepsyVon Willebrands",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Chigi's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Chigis are a toy sized dogs with high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets a few walks per day with several good, active play sessions mixed in.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Their eyes should be cleaned daily. If you don't clean them, they may do it, themselves, on your furniture. To avoid this, use a clean damp cloth and wipe them every morning.A main concern will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as small breeds are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly, and YouTube can help with teeth brushing and nail trimming tutorials.If you find your dog dragging their bottom or \"scooting,\" they may need their anal glands expressed. This is a task for your groomer or vet and worth every penny to have it done professionally.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Chigi diet should be formulated for a toy sized breed with high energy. They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day.As with all dogs, the Chigi's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Chigi's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Chigi coats are often a mix of their Corgi and Chihuahua parents' coats and colors. The main colors of the Chigi's coats are fawn, black, white, and cream. Sometimes their coats are solid, but usually they're a combination of colors.They typically have short, straight coats, with a thick undercoat, and they're generally pretty easy to groom. A few brushes per week should suffice. Baths should be sparse as their fur tends to dry out, and they need their natural oils for optimum radiance.Due to their toy sized status, Chigis may not be particularly suited for extreme weather. However their Corgi parentage does make them somewhat suited for cold weather. Depending on your Chigi, they may have a nice, built-in winter coat.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Because the Chigi is a small dog, they can be easily injured by overly excited children. Chigis enjoy family life and would be nicely suited for a family with older kids who know how to play gently. The Chigi makes a great, active companion and loves kids.When it comes to other pets, Chigis can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly. Early socialization to other dogs and pets will be key.The Chigi is not recommended for dog parks because they could roam and try to herd other dogs.Learn more about Chigis by reading up on their parent breeds the Chihuahua and Corgi.",
