  "description": {
    "Highlights": "The Affenhuahua is a mixed breed dog. They are not purebreds like their Affenpinscher or Chihuahua parents.Affenhuahuas have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.The main colors of Affenhuahuas are black, brown, fawn, and cream. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colors or have white and grey spotting.They usually have short coats, and may be a good choice for allergy sufferers. There are longer-coated Affenhuahuas, though they may not be as allergy friendly. Brush your dog once a week.Since the Affenhuahua can be easily injured by overly excited children, they may prefer to be around adults or older kids who know how to play gently.Affenhuahuas aren't naturally fond of other animals and may prefer to be the solo pet in the home. But many get along just fine with other dogs and cats, so it comes down to training, socialization, and the luck of the draw.Affenhuahuas can be stubborn and difficult to housetrain, but for an energetic, diligent owner, the dog's desire to please will help keep training on course.",
    "History": "Affenhuahuas have likely existed naturally thoughout the years, but designer breeders started intentionally mixing Affenpinschers and Chihuahuas sometime in the late 1990s or early 2000s, likely in the United States.Breeders wanted to combine the two small breeds to create a sweet lapdog who could also alert their owners of potential intruders or danger. They continued to make Affenhuahuas as the demand for the mixed breed dogs climbed.Even though the Affenhuahua breed got its start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you. Check your local shelters, look up rescues, or check with breed specific Affenpinscher or Chihuahua rescues, as they sometimes take in mixed breed dogs and find homes for them.",
    "Size": "As the Affenhuahua is a relatively new mixed breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between Chihuahua and Affenpinscher parents, you can expect Affenhuahuas to be on the small side.Most weigh in at four to twelve pounds and range in height from six to twelve inches from the shoulder. Many can be smaller or larger than average.",
    "Personality": "The Affenhuahua is a small mixed breed dog who acts a lot bigger than they actually are! Like their Chihuahua parents, Affenhuahuas can be somewhat stubborn, even with their humans. Still, Affenhuahua enthusiasts say that the small crossbred dog is highly trainable, as long as their training is consistent.This lapdog oscillates from having large amounts of spontaneous energy--think having the zoomies!--to being a complete couch potato. If you are looking for a small lapdog who enjoys playing a round of fetch or tug-of-war as much as they do snuggling and binge-watching the latest series, the Affenhuahua might be the right pup for you.Like both of their parents, the Affenhuahua is often described as \"yappy.\" This small dog will alert you of any potential danger--or little things they misinterpret as danger, like a knock on the door. Since they are smaller, they may even become somewhat protective of their human and get snippy with strangers. In order to avoid any unwanted guarding behavior, it's important to start training your Affenhuahua as early as possible.These dogs do best with early training to curb any unwanted barking habits. They can be stubborn and difficult to housetrain, but for an energetic, diligent owner, the dog's desire to please will help keep training on course.Affenhuahuas also tend to latch on to one family member most of all, though they can get along with others in the house. This small dog may be best suited to a one-person home or smaller families, as they love being the center of attention.",
    "Health": "The Affenhuahua breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Chihuahua and Affenpinscher also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Affenhuahuas suffer from include:Collapsed TracheaHip DysplasiaDental DiseasePatellar Luxation",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, be sure to keep regular veterinary checkups for your Affenhuahua in order to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Affenhuahuas are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Affenhuahua's care will be maintaining their oral health, as small dogs are prone to dental health issues. Be sure to brush their teeth daily. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Affenhuahua diet should be formulated for a small breed with high energy. These small dogs also have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so be sure to stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their amount of treats, too.As with all dogs, the Affenhuahua's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Affenhuahua's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Affenhuahua coats are often a mix of their Affenpinscher and Chihuahua parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Affenhuahuas are black, brown, fawn, and cream. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colors or have white and grey spotting.They usually have short coats, and they're generally considered to be a good choice for allergy sufferers. There are longer-coated, scruffier Affenhuahuas, too, though they may not be as allergy friendly. Luckily, both coats are very easy to groom. A good brushing per week will probably do.Because they tend to have shorter coats (and are a small breed), Affenhuahuas aren't particularly suited for extreme weather. You'll likely need a coat in the winter for your dog, and you may need to apply dog sunscreen to the ears, nose, and sensitive areas where there's less fur coverage in the summer months.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Since the Affenhuahua is a small mixed breed, they can be easily injured by overly excited children. Affenhuahuas prefer to be mostly around adults or older kids who know how to play gently. That said, for children who learn early how to properly approach and play with a small dog, the Affenhuahua can make a great, active companion.When it comes to other pets, Affenhuahuas can be friendly with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. It's best if they get used to other pets at a young age, but that doesn't mean an older Affenhuahua can't learn how to be less territorial! Still, Affenhuahuas aren't naturally fond of other animals and may prefer to be the solo pet in the home.But many Affenhuahuas get along just fine with other dogs and cats, so it really comes down to training, socialization, and the luck of the draw.",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed specific rescue for Affenhuahuas because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Affenpinscher or Chihuahua breed specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:Chihuahua Rescue & TransportAffenpinscher Rescue of AmericaYou can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!DogTime is a participant in the Chewy Affiliate Program designed to provide a means for sites to earn fees by advertising and linking to Chewy.com."
