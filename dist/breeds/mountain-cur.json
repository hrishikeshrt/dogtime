  "intro": "The Mountain Cur dog breed originated in the mountains of Kentucky and Tennessee. They were a major part of the early settlers\u2019 lives and helped their humans while they developed farms in mountainous, rural, southern regions. They acted as watchdogs on farms, assisted with hunting, and even herded livestock. Dogs of this breed still perform those same tasks today among other jobs, including being loyal companions.\nThe breed is also called the \u201cMountain Kerr\u201d and is sometimes referred to as \u201cthe pioneer\u2019s dog.\u201d Although these are purebred dogs, you may still find them in shelters and rescues. Remember to adopt! Don\u2019t shop if this breed is right for you.\nMountain Curs are not a good choice for those who live in apartments because they require a lot of space and exercise. They\u2019re also very intelligent and oftentimes stubborn. These dogs do best with experienced pet parents who can assert their roles as leaders while being diligent with obedience training.\nSee below for complete list of dog breed traits and facts about Mountain Curs!",

    "History": "The exact history of the Mountain Cur is not known, but they are believed to have appeared in the United States in the 1940s. The Mountain Cur likely descended from other \u201cCur\u201d breeds from Europe.These dogs were used by pioneers to catch wild game, guard their homes, and protect their livestock. Pioneers saw them as an essential part of settling in the mountains because they were very versatile and useful companions. They were not only hardworking and extremely protective of their territory and family, but they were also very loyal and affectionate dogs.Mountain Curs are well trained to use the technique of \u201ctreeing,\u201d or essentially chasing prey up into a tree. The Mountain Cur is an excellent climber and hunter and provided food for their families.The breed was assigned to the Foundation Stock Service group of the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 2017.

    "Personality": "The Mountain Cur is a fearless watchdog and will fight to protect their territory and those who live in it. They are wary of strangers, but once they know the newcomers aren\u2019t a threat, they'll gradually warm up to them. The breed was historically known as a sort of \u201call purpose\u201d dog since they could be trained to do so many different jobs.Mountain Curs are natural athletes who enjoy the outdoors and participating in sports and hunting. They were used to hunt small game, so they have a strong prey drive. The Mountain Cur would actually prefer to spend more of their time outdoors than indoors and thrive in a home that has a large yard.This is a strong-willed and stubborn breed, so they're not the right dog for amateur pet parents. They need to be taught at a young age that they are not the leader and need very firm and consistent obedience training as puppies.While they may seem intimidating in size and have a deep, loud bark, they are excellent family dogs and adore children. Even though that may seem like a positive trait for a dog who's very protective of kids, they can get overprotective if they sense threats. This is another reason why they need to be exposed to many different people while young.During training, make sure to use positive reinforcement and avoid using any harsh training methods. They want, more than anything, to please their humans, so giving them tasks like hunting will be very satisfying for them and also help them burn off some energy!",
    "Health": "Mountain Curs are known to be rather healthy dogs with very long lifespans. There are no real health issues that they're predisposed to since this specific breed was carefully bred.However, some of the more common health problems Mountain Curs can suffer from include:Skin infectionsDry skin/sensitive skinParasites/ticks/fleas if the dog is predominantly outsideEar infections",
    "Care": "The Mountain Cur is a very high energy dog breed and needs both mental and physical stimulation daily to prevent destructive behavior from occurring. They should have plenty of obedience training as well as other physical activities to do from puppyhood on so that you can have a manageable and well behaved dog as an adult.Since they were bred to perform tasks, they always need to have a job to do. Whether it\u2019s treeing, hiking, jogging, or other sports, the Mountain Cur has to have a devoted pet parent to meet those needs.If you love the outdoors or live on a farm, the Mountain Cur is the ideal companion for you. They will be more than happy to patrol the perimeter of your home and would risk their own life to protect their families.While these dogs love spending time running in open areas and enjoying the great outdoors, make sure to avoid dog parks. Unfortunately, the Mountain Cur is rather skeptical of other dogs and, despite socialization efforts, may still not have a safe or enjoyable time interacting amongst other dogs.Aside from their exercise needs, Mountain Curs also require dental hygiene and nail care. Try to brush your Mountain Cur\u2019s teeth twice a week to remove tartar buildup and bacteria as well. Ideally, daily brushing should be performed.Trim their nails once a month, or as necessary. Their nails may not need to be trimmed as frequently if they spend a significant amount of time walking on concrete or other surfaces outside that will naturally dull the nails. If you can hear the nails clicking on the floor, they\u2019re too long.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Mountain Cur diet should be formulated for a medium to large breed dog with high energy levels. The Mountain Cur does not typically have a tendency to gain weight since they are such an active breed, but you must make sure they're getting the proper nutrition.As with all dogs, the Mountain Cur's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Mountain Cur's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs -- including weight, energy, and health -- to make a specific recommendation.",
