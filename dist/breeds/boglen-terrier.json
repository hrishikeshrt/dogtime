  "intro": "The Boglen Terrier is a mixed breed dog \u2014 a cross between the Beagle and Boston Terrier dog breeds. These dogs are known to be playful, spunky, loyal, and often times, stubborn. This lovable and perky mix has proven to become quite popular among owners from various backgrounds. \nBoglen Terriers are also called Boston Beagle Terrier or Boggle. However, confusion often arises since Boggle is another name for a Boxer and Beagle mix. Despite their unfortunate status as a designer breed, you may find these mixed breed dogs in shelters and rescues. So remember to adopt! Don\u2019t shop!\nThese adorable pups prefer big families because there are more people to interact with, and they don\u2019t like being left alone for any length of time. They\u2019re considered a high energy pup so they\u2019re best suited for active adults or families with plenty of people to interact and play with.\nThey will thrive in a household with a backyard, but will also be content living in an apartment as long as the pup can burn off energy with regular walks and trips to the dog park. Make sure you have a secure yard, as they\u2019re prone to tracking and wandering off.\nSee below for all Boglen Terrier facts and mixed dog breed characteristics!",

    "Highlights": "Bolgen Terriers are mixed breed dogs. They are not purebreds like their Boston Terrier or Beagle parents.While one of the most predominant colors Bolgen Terriers come in is brindle, they can also be brindle and white, black and white, brown and white, and rarely tri-colored.Bolgen Terriers usually have short coats and are not considered allergy friendly, though their coats are very easy to groom.Because of their pack dog heritage, Boglen Terriers enjoy company and don't like to be left alone. Another dog or even a cat may help meet their companionship needs.Boglen Terriers have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.They tend to only be vocal when a doorbell rings or they spot something outside but rarely howl like their Beagle parent.",
    "History": "The Boglen Terrier dog breed may have existed naturally over the years, but designer breeders started intentionally mixing Beagles and Boston Terriers in the late 1990s or early 2000s, likely in North America.Breeders wanted to mix the two parent breeds to create a silly, adorable, family watchdog. They also wanted to make a healthy mixed breed. This mix helped extend the short snout of the Boston Terrier to alleviate breathing issues and also to reduce the risk of eye infections they are prone to. The Boglen has proven to be a hardy mix that is gaining popularity.Breeders continued to create Boglen Terriers as demand for the mixed breed pups climbed.Even though the Boglen Terrier got their start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you.Check your local shelters, look up Boglen Terrier rescues, or check with breed-specific Beagle and Boston Terrier rescues, as they sometimes take in mixed breeds.Boglen Terriers are recognized by:ACHC - American Canine Hybrid ClubDBR - Designer Breed RegistryDDKC - Designer Dogs Kennel ClubDRA - Dog Registry of America, Inc.IDCR - International Designer Canine Registry\u00ae",
    "Size": "As with all mixes, the pups may take on one parent's size more so than the other, but the Boglen is considered a small breed dog just like its parents. Most Boglens weigh in at ten to 40 pounds and range in height from twelve to 17 inches.Since both parent breeds tend to become overweight easily, you should discuss with your veterinarian what the appropriate weight is for your dog's size.",
    "Personality": "Many Boglen Terrier lovers describe these dogs' personalities as \"playful.\" Although they are the size of your average lap dog, their high energy levels mean they'd probably prefer a game of fetch to a cuddle session. Make sure you have a secure yard as they are prone to wandering off.Boglen Terriers are gentle, sweet, and funny. They will make you laugh with their non-stop antics and silly behavior.Especially being part Beagle, these dogs can often times be stubborn and very scent driven, meaning it is not a good idea to keep your Boglen off leash. Patience is necessary when training begins and as stated before, they are extremely food driven which makes training easier. Boglen Terrier people spend a lot of time trying to out-think their dogs, and they often must resort to food rewards to lure them into a state of temporary obedience.Both parent breeds are intelligent, quick learners, and eager to please, so training these dogs will be easy as long as you are firm and consistent.Like every dog, the Boglen Terrier needs early socialization--exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences--when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Boglen Terrier puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.The outgoing nature of the Boglen makes it a perfect dog for someone who is active and can give the pup plenty of attention. They adore kids and make excellent family dogs that will be able to keep up with the energy of a child. They'll enjoy a game of fetch just as much as an interactive brain stimulating toy or a long walk with their owner.Since these dogs get so attached to their owners, they are often not best left alone for very extended periods of time as they can be destructive if not kept busy. The best way to prevent this is to start young with getting your puppy used to your routine, especially if owners work all day.These dogs are notorious for their loyalty and, despite their size, make excellent watch dogs. They are not considered yappy but will let their owner know if a stranger is at the door.",
    "Health": "The Boglen breed is a generally very hardy dog that has had several health problems lessened by being crossbred. For example, the Boston Terrier has a short snout and bulging eyes. The elongated snout from the Beagle helps ease breathing issues and with eyes more like a Beagle's, they are less prone to a condition called Cherry-eye.The Boglen Terrier breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Beagle and Boston Terrier also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Boglen Terriers suffer from include:Ear InfectionsObesityDry SkinSkin AllergiesInverterbral Disk DiseaseHip DysplasiaCataractsPatellar Luxation",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Boglen Terrier's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Boglen Terriers are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in. Luckily, their high energy levels make it easier for them to keep off extra weight with appropriate exercise.The ears of a Boglen are often floppy, so it is important that owners check and clean the ears daily to prevent infections. Check their ears for debris and pests and clean them as recommended by your vet. This breed is prone to ear infections. If your dog develops a pungent aroma, chances are they may have an ear infection and may require a trip to the vet.Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this if it's too difficult to do by yourself.Your main concern when it comes to your Boglen Terrier's care will be maintaining their oral health. The length of the Boglen's snout may differ among each dog, but in general, the teeth of small breed dogs are known to be prone to dental issues, and it's best to start to brush your pup's teeth when they are young to get them used to it.As they grow, you should brush their teeth daily. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly. Dental chews are also helpful. Please note, if your dog eats their dental chew in under ten minutes, it may not be very helpful for cleaning their teeth.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Boglen Terrier diet should be formulated for a small, active breed. Beagles and Boston Terriers are notorious for being very food driven and tend to become overweight quite easily, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and limit treats.As with all dogs, the Boglen Terrier's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Boglen Terrier's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Boglen Terrier coats are often a mix of their Beagle and Boston Terrier parents' coats and colors. While one of the most predominant colors they come in is brindle, they can also be brindle and white, black and white, brown and white, and rarely tri-colored.They usually have short coats and are not considered allergy friendly, though their coats are very easy to groom. A good brushing per week will probably do.One very common issue with short, smooth-coated breeds is that they tend to get dry skin rather easily. Boglens are considered light shedders due to their short fine hair, but excessive shedding may occur in stressful situations.Because they tend to have shorter coats, Boglen Terriers aren't particularly suited for extreme weather. You'll likely need a coat in the winter for your dog. While their short coat can keep them cool in the heat, you may need to apply sunscreen to the ears, nose, and sensitive areas where there's less fur coverage in the summer months.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Boglen Terriers bond with everyone in the family, especially children. They can be rambunctious when playing, however, so they need to be properly socialized and supervised with very young children.In addition, Boglens may be \"mouthy,\" grabbing things, including your or your child's hand, with their mouths to play. They do this in fun and can be trained not to do this. Sometimes when puppies are teething, children need to understand that nibbles from a pup aren't aggressive towards them. These dogs love kids and will quickly bond and become excellent playmates.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and supervise any interactions. Teach your child never to approach any dog while they're eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Because of their pack dog heritage, Boglen Terriers enjoy company and don't like to be left alone. Another dog or even a cat may help meet their companionship needs. Boglens generally get along with other dogs, as well as cats, as long as they are socialized young.Of course, personalities may clash but several Boglen owners say their dogs get along well with any size breed. One owner DogTime spoke with said her Boglen will often challenge larger breed dogs. Boglens are highly social animals and certainly won't mind sharing the household with other pets and children as well.Every dog's personality is different, so the real key to getting your pup used to different situations is early training and socialization. Make sure to expose them to other dogs, cats, children, and strangers when they are young so they will be highly adaptable.Learn more about this awesome mixed breed by reading about their parents, the Beagle and Boston Terrier.",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Boglen Terriers because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Boston Terrier or Beagle breed-specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:MidAmerica Boston Terrier Rescue Inc.Colorado Beagle Rescue, Inc.You can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!"
