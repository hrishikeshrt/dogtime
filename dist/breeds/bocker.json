  "intro": "The Bocker is a mixed breed dog \u2014 a cross between the Cocker Spaniel and Beagle dog breeds. Small, affectionate, and curious by nature, these pups inherited some of the best qualities from both of their parents.\nThe Cocker Spaniel and Beagle mixes we call Bockers also go by the names Beakers or Beagle Spaniel. Despite their unfortunate status as a designer breed, you can find these mixed breed dogs in shelters and breed-specific rescues, so remember to adopt! Don\u2019t shop!\nThese adorable pups do well in apartments and houses with fenced yards, whether it\u2019s with single seniors or households with children. Just make sure the yard is secure, as they have a tendency to track and follow scents. Their wanderlust could lead them into dangerous situations, like traffic. So be careful and take extra precautions.\nBockers love endless play sessions and activity. They should not be left alone for long periods. Multiple pet families would be ideal. Isolation is their biggest enemy.\nSee below for all Bocker facts and mixed dog breed characteristics!",

    "Highlights": "Bockers are mixed breed dogs. They are not purebreds like their Beagle and Cocker Spaniel parents.The main colors of Bockers are black, brown, white, merle, tri-color, and bi-color. They are rarely a solid color and generally a combination of two or more colors.Their coats can be short and coarse like the Beagle or curly like the Cocker Spaniel. One brush every other day and a bath every few months with a mild shampoo should meet their grooming needs.Because the Bocker is a small dog, they can be easily injured by overly excited children. Bockers prefer to be mostly around adults or older kids who know how to play gently.Isolation and Bockers do not mix. If left alone for long periods, they may exhibit destructive behavior.Bockers enjoy playing games but may get sidetracked by new smells and go off on a new adventure. Keep a tight reign on your pup for their own safety.Bockers are suited for any size family and will love all members equally, but they can form a strong bond with their main caregiver.",
    "History": "The Bocker mixed dog breed may have existed naturally over the years, but designer breeders started intentionally mixing Beagles and Cocker Spaniels in the late 1990s, likely in North America.Breeders wanted to mix the two parent breeds to create a new companion dog and minimize the health issues that many pure breeds suffer from. They continued to create Bockers as demand for the mixed breed pups climbed.Even though Bockers got their start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you.Check your local shelters, look up Bocker rescues, or check with breed-specific Beagle or Cocker Spaniel rescues, as they often help to re-home the ever increasing number of mixes in need of adoption.Bockers are recognized by:American Canine Hybrid ClubDesigner Dogs Kennel ClubDog Registry of America, Inc.International Designer Canine Registry\u00ae",
    "Size": "As the Bockers is a relatively new mixed breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between Cocker Spaniel and Beagle parents, you can expect Bockers to be on the small side.Most weigh in at 20 to 30 pounds and range in height from twelve to 15 inches at the shoulder. However, many can be smaller or larger.Male Bockers typically run a bit larger than females.",
    "Personality": "Bocker parents often describe their dogs as being playful, sweet and intelligent. They have high energy and enjoy lots of different activities. They enjoy playing games but may get sidetracked by new smells and go off on a new adventure. Keep a tight reign on your pup for their own safety.These dogs are highly alert and will notify you when someone is at your door or nearby. Bockers are described as naturally happy creatures and highly intelligent. While Beagles are not easily trainable, Cocker Spaniels are, so it'll be the luck of the draw to see which traits your pup ends up with.Bockers are suited for any size family and will love all members equally, but they can form a strong bond with their main caregiver. Isolation and Bockers do not mix. If left alone for long periods, they may exhibit destructive behavior. Give them lots of love and attention, and involve them in your daily life.",
    "Health": "The Bocker breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Cocker Spaniel and Beagle also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Bockers are typically pretty health dogs, but some of their parent breeds' health issues to watch out for include:Eye problemsOtitis externalProgressive retinal atrophyCanine glaucomaCherry eyeEar infectionsHeart diseaseGlaucomaEpilepsyHypothyroidismIntervertebral disc disease",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Bocker's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will help keep your dog healthy.Bockers are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least two walks per day with lots of activity and play sessions mixed it.If your Bocker has their Beagle parent's drop ears, air doesn't circulate well inside, and they are prone to ear infections. Check their ears at least every two weeks for signs of infection or waxy buildup. Check them also if you notice your Beagle shaking their head a lot or scratching at their ears. Never allow water or oils to remain in their ears.Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Bocker's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as small breeds are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly. Dental chews can also help with this.Tip: Chews that take your dog between 20 minutes and several days are more effective than the ones they gobble up in five minutes.Begin accustoming your Bocker to being brushed and examined during puppyhood. Handle their paws frequently--dogs are touchy about their feet. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when they're an adult.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Bocker diet should be formulated for a small dog with high energy. They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so it's best to stick to a feeding schedule. High quality food is recommended. Two to three small meals through the day is better for digestion with this breed.As with all dogs, the Bocker's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Bocker's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Bocker coats are often a mix of their Cocker Spaniel and Beagle parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Bockers are black, brown, white, merle, tri-color, and bi-color. They are rarely a solid color and generally a combination of two or more colors.Their coats can be short and coarse like the Beagle or curly like the Cocker Spaniel. One brush every other day and a bath every few months with a mild shampoo should meet their grooming needs. Their coats have natural oils that brushing can help distribute evenly. Too much bathing can strip their coats natural oils.Bockers are not super fond of the cold. If you live in a cold climate, you may to get a warm winter jacket. If you enjoy taking your Bocker for joyrides during the summer, don't leave home without having enough water for you and your dog. Keeping a bowl in your car year round is a great way to plan ahead. If your pup will be in direct sunlight for long periods consider applying dog safe sunblock.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Bockers bond with everyone in the family and can enjoy endless play sessions with older children. Because the Bocker is a small dog, they can be easily injured by overly excited children. Bockers prefer to be mostly around adults or older kids who know how to play gently. That said, for children who learn early how to properly approach and play with a small dog, the Bocker can make a great, active companion.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and supervise any interactions. Teach your child never to approach any dog while they're eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Because of their pack dog heritage, Bockers enjoy company and don't like to be left alone. Another dog or even a cat will help meet their companionship needs.Reading about their parent Cocker Spaniel and Beagle breeds is the best way to learn more about your Bocker.",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Bockers because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Beagle or Cocker Spaniel breed-specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:Oldies But Goodies Cocker RescueColorado Beagle Rescue, Inc.You can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!"
