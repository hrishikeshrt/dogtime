  "intro": "A true companion dog, the Bolognese dog breed loves to be at their family\u2019s side. However, they also loves getting their way and can be quite crafty about it, so be careful \u2014 you could find yourself being manipulated by a ten-pound furball.\nEven though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Remember to adopt! Don\u2019t shop if you want to bring a dog home.\nSensitive and loving, Bologness are true companion dogs. They pack a lot of personality in a tiny body, and they\u2019ll readily take to apartment life. These pups don\u2019t much care for being left alone for long hours of the day. Instead, they\u2019ll prefer to join you wherever you go. But even though these pups adore their humans, they also have a stubborn side when it comes to training. Teach these dogs with plenty of positive reinforcement and avoid harsh rebukes. If you do, you\u2019ll have a loving, well behaved family member who won\u2019t leave your side.\nSee below for complete list of Bolognese characteristics!",
