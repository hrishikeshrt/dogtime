  "intro": "A descendent of the English Foxhound, the American English Coonhoound is a hunting dog breed known for their speed, endurance, and loud voice in the field. The\u2019ll bark and bay at home, too, making them a poor choice if you\u2019ve got nearby neighbors. They need lots of exercise.\nEven though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Remember to adopt! Don\u2019t shop if you want to bring a dog home.\nThese dogs are loving, intelligent, easy to train, and fairly easy to groom. However, novice pet parents should beware. They also need firm, consistent training and lots of mental and physical activity. If you can\u2019t keep up with seemingly endless walks and play sessions, you may want to consider a less energetic breed. But if you can provide the exercise they need, a very secure yard for them to roam, and patient training, you\u2019ll have an adoring furry family member.\nSee below for complete list of American English Coonhound characteristics!",
  "description": {
    "": "Once known as the Virginia Hound and adapted to hunt the rough terrain and tricky raccoons of the American colonies, the American English Coonhound is famous for his speed and endurance.He began as a dual-purpose dog who hunted fox by day and raccoon by night. He eagerly seeks his quarry, singing out as he hunts, a trait that carries over into home life. This hound will bark. On the plus side, he's pleasant toward people and other dogs. If you won't be hunting him, plan to give this swift and competitive dog plenty of daily exercise in other ways to prevent him from becoming frustrated and destructive. He'd make a good companion for a runner.",
    "Size": "Males stand 24 to 26 inches at the shoulder; females, 23 to 25 inches. Their weight should be in proportion to height.",
