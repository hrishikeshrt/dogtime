    "Highlights": "Horgis are mixed breed dogs. They are not purebreds like their Siberian Husky or Corgi parents.The main colors of Horgis are black, cream, red, sable, and fawn. Their coats are usually a mixture of two or more colors.Horgis are heavy shedders and will need a daily brushing.Because the Horgi comes from a line of working parents, a strong training program should instilled early. They are prone to mischief and have a high prey drive.Horgis have an affinity for children, but thanks to their herding instincts, they sometimes nip at children's feet or ankles. They're eager learners, though, and can be trained out of this behavior at a young age.Horgis will have lots of energy and enjoy walking and hiking. They are highly alert but not aggressive or territorial. These pups make great companion dogs for active people.",
    "History": "The Horgi dog breed may have existed naturally over the years, but designer breeders started intentionally mixing Corgis and Huskies in the late 1990s, likely in North America.Breeders wanted to mix the two parent breeds to create a miniature Husky--a small herding dog. They quickly became a favorite companion pup. Breeders continued to create Horgis as demand for the mixed breed pups climbed.Even though the Horgi breed got its start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you.Check your local shelters, look up Horgi rescues, or check with breed-specific Corgi and Husky rescues, as they sometimes help to re-home mixed breed pups.This breed is currently not recognized by the American Kennel Club but is a favorite of Queen Elizabeth.",
    "Size": "As the Horgi is a relatively new breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between Corgi and Siberian Husky parents, you can expect Horgis to be on the small side.Most weigh in at 20 to 50 pounds and range in height from twelve to 15 inches at the shoulder. However, being such a new mixed breed, many can be smaller or larger.",
    "Personality": "Many Horgi lovers describe these dogs' personalities as friendly and playful. Although most are the size of your average lap dog, their high energy levels mean they'd probably prefer chasing squirrels in your back yard than afternoon naps and cuddle sessions.Both parents are working breeds, Horgis will have lots of energy and enjoy walking and hiking. They are highly alert but not aggressive or territorial. These pups make great companion dogs for active people.Horgis do best with early training. They are obedient and need to please their owner; however, they are curious and may test you. Positive re-enforcement and consistency is key with this mixed breed.",
    "Health": "The Horgi breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Husky and Corgi also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Horgi's suffer from include:Back problemsHip dysplasiaDegenerative myelopathy",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Horgi's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Horgis are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets a good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day. If the Husky parentage prevails, they may require more exercise to sustain their needs.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Horgi's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as smaller breeds, like Corgis, are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.Because the Horgi comes from a line of working parents, a strong training program should instilled early. They are prone to mischief and have a high prey drive. Never leave them unsupervised around small animals.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Horgi diet should be formulated for a small breed with high energy. Horgis are prone to back problems that can be exacerbated by extra pounds. This breed also has a tendency to overeat. Stick to a feeding schedule with portion control and limit their snacks.As with all dogs, the Horgi's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Horgi's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Horgi coats are often a mix of their Siberian Husky and Pembroke Welsh Corgi parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Horgis are black, cream, red, sable, and fawn. Their coats are usually a mixture of two or more colors.Horgis are heavy shedders and will need a daily brushing. You may want to consider investing in a robot vacuum. See if the robot vacuum is something you would like to try. Horgis coats should never be clipped. Clipping a double coated dog means that their hair may grow back incorrectly, and they may lose some important fur that help them with insulation during the winter and cooling during the summer.Their double coats also mean they would be able to withstand cold weather for longer periods of time than many other breeds.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Horgis have an affinity for children, but thanks to their herding instincts, they sometimes nip at children's feet or ankles. They're eager learners, though, and can be trained out of this behavior at a young age.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while they're eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Huskies are pack dogs with high prey drive, and Horgis can be, too. They'd do well in multiple dog families; just make sure to start socialization early. Horgis should not be unsupervised around cats or other small animals.Learn more about this breed from their parents, the Siberian Husky and Corgi dog breeds.",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Horgis because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Siberian Husky or Corgi breed-specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:Raven's Husky Haven and RescuePet's Second ChanceYou can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!"
