  "description": {
    "Highlights": "Goberians are mixed breed dogs. They are not purebreds like their Golden Retriever or Siberian Husky parents.Goberian coats commonly come in colors including white, black, gray, brown, and cream, and the coat is usually a mix of two or even more colors.Their fur is straight or wavy, and their double coat is ideal for cold climates. They are not well suited for hot climates.Goberians have high exercise needs and may overeat. It's important to stick to proper exercise and diet to prevent weight gain.These dogs need lots of physical activity. Owners must usually walk them for twelve miles or more each week.Goberians love their human families, even children, and are quite protective. They make great watchdogs.",
    "History": "As a newer hybrid dog, not too much is known about the Goberian's history. However, when it comes to the Goberian's parent breeds, there is a lot of esteemed heritage to dig into.Originally developed by the Chukchi indigenous tribe in Russia, the Siberian Husky was used to pull sleds and help with hunting in cold environments. When the breed hit Alaska in the early 1900s, they helped out during a diphtheria outbreak--and completed an epic 658 mile serum delivery run in a fifth of the predicted time! When it comes to the Golden Retriever, the breed dates back to the Victorian times.The Goberian is a designer dog breed, but many of them, unfortunately, end up in shelters. So consider contacting your local rescue groups and shelters if you're thinking about adding a Goberian to your home.",
    "Size": "The Goberian is usually described as a large-sized dog--although with all newer dog breeds, the exact size standards may vary.Most weigh in at 45 to 90 pounds and range in height from 20 to 24 inches.",
    "Personality": "There's a lot of independence going on in the Goberian's heritage, but in general, this breed likes to be around people and displays very social and friendly characteristics. If you're looking for any sort of a watchdog, the Goberian is loyal and very alert--this breed will let you know when strangers approach.Outdoor space is essential for the Goberian's lifestyle. The dog is super energetic and very active--hiking up steep trails, running along during a jog, and playing at the dog park for extended sessions are all going to need to be part of the Goberian's routine. At times, you might feel like you're struggling to keep up with your dog!Goberians have a reputation for being smart, but if your dog inherits more Siberian Husky than Golden Retriever, you might be dealing with a more stubborn and independent dog than anticipated. But patience and positive reinforcement works wonders on this breed--and it's worth it to experience one of the true stars of the dog world!",
    "Health": "Goberians are generally considered to be healthy dogs--although the breed can suffer from issues and ailments inherited from its parent breeds.Some of the more common health problems Goberians suffer from include:BloatEpilepsyHeart issuesVon Willebrand's DiseaseOsteochondritis dissecans",
    "Care": "Just like with any dog, it's important to keep up your Goberian's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Due to their high exercise needs, be alert that your Goberian could develop health problems due to overeating and insufficient activity. Monitor meals and make sure you stick to a regular exercise regimen that involves walking or running over twelve miles each week.Make sure to brush your Goberian's teeth three times a week to lessen the likelihood of dental issues. Once a week, wipe down the breed's ears to stave off any potential infections. Also check that the dog's nails are clipped regularly--ask your vet to recommend a precise schedule. As the Goberian is such an active and outdoors dog, periodically look over their paw pads to make sure they're in good condition and not damaged.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Goberian diet should be formulated for a large-sized breed with high energy.Goberians need to stick to a heathy diet as overeating can cause weight gain--especially if they do not receive the high levels of exercise they crave.As with all dogs, the Goberian's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Goberian's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "The Goberian's coat commonly comes in colors including white, black, gray, brown, and cream, and the coat is usually a mix of two or even more colors.This breed's coat is long and dense. The fur is sometimes straight and sometimes described as wavy. Shedding is minimal--brushing the breed's coat three times a week should be enough to keep it smooth and clean. Being that the Goberian spends a lot of time outside, bath times should be taken as needed.The Goberian's double coat is ideal for cold climates. The amount of insulation provided by the coat means that this breed does not do well in hot environments. This is a dog that's going to drink a lot of water during the summer!",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Family is important to the Goberian, and this mixed breed is great around children. If you teach your kids to interact with the dog in a respectful and appropriate way, they will be able to enjoy joint play sessions together in the family yard or at the park--just make sure they are supervised due to the Goberian's athletic abilities.In general, Goberians are great around other pets, although you should always exercise caution before introducing new pets to each other.As with all dogs, early socialization pays off, so make sure to reward your Goberian for good behavior and use positive reinforcement, rather than yelling or scolding, to bring the best out of this excellent and eye-catching breed.",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Goberians because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Golden Retriever or Siberian Husky breed-specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:As Good as GoldRaven's Husky Haven and RescueYou can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!"
