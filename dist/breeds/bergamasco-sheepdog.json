Some believed the dog descended from the Gallic herder breed, the Briard.Italian fans of the breed, however, point out that if the breed traveled west from the Middle East, they would have to hit Italy first. The breed earned its name from the Italian City of Bergamo, up in the Alps, where its flocked coat helped keep these dogs safe from the mountains' harsh conditions.The breed started to diminish in Italy after World War II, but breed enthusiasts worked to keep the ancient breed stable. In 1956, the breed was accepted into the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI).In 2015, the AKC officially started recognizing the Bergamasco Sheepdog in its Herding group.
