    "Highlights": "Rottles are mixed breed dogs. They are not purebreds like their Rottweiler or Poodle parents.The main colors of Rottles are brown, black, white, red, gray, and blue. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colorsThey tend to be lower shedding dogs, but that doesn't mean they're hypoallergenic. A good brushing every other day should keep your Rottle's coat healthy.Rottles are relatively easy to train compared to other mixed breeds, as long as training starts at an early age. Due to their high intelligence, they can become destructive if they get bored.Rottles have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in. Be sure to include some mentally stimulating games.Generally, the Rottle is considered a family friendly mixed breed dog. They can be affectionate in nature, but it's still important to supervise and teach children how to safely play with dogs.",
    "History": "The Rottle mixed dog breed may have existed naturally over the years, but designer breeders started intentionally mixing Rottweilers and Poodles sometime in the 1980s, likely in North America.Although there isn't much information available as to why folks started breeding Rottles, it can be assumed breeders were looking for a highly trainable and affectionate dog with less shedding than the short-haired Rottweiler. They continued to create Rottles as demand for the mixed breed pups climbed.Even though the Rottle breed got their start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you.Check your local shelters, look up Rottle rescues, or check with breed specific Rottweiler or Poodle rescues, as they sometimes take in mixed breed dogs and find homes for them.",
    "Size": "As the Rottle is a relatively new mixed breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between Rottweiler and Poodle parents, you can expect Rottles to be on the medium to large side.Most weigh in at 60 to 90 pounds and range in height from twelve to 27 inches at the shoulder. However, many can be smaller or larger than average.",
    "Personality": "Many Rottle parents describe their mixed breed dogs as incredibly smart and eager to please. This makes training Rottles relatively easy compared to other mixed breeds, as long as training starts at an early age.Due to their high intelligence, they can become somewhat destructive if they get bored or don't have anything to occupy them. They can also grow protective of their favorite humans and may bark at unexpected guests. If you want a watchdog who is also super snuggly with your family, the Rottle may be the right pup for you.These dogs are incredibly trainable, and the sooner you start, the better. Rottles who are untrained or unsocialized may develop negative coping patterns like resource protecting. Be sure to use a lot of positive reinforcement with your Rottle, as they crave your validation.Rottles can get along in a one-person household, but they truly are fabulous family dogs.",
    "Health": "The Rottle breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Rottweiler and Poodle also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Rottles suffer from include:DysplasiaHeart issuesCorneal dystrophyBloatVon Williebrand's Disease",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Rottle's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Rottles are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in. Be sure to include some mentally stimulating games, as Rottles are smart pups!Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Be sure to maintain their oral health. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Rottle diet should be formulated for a medium-sized breed with lots of energy. They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their amount of treats, too!As with all dogs, the Rottle's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Rottle's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Rottle coats are often a mix of their Rottweiler and Poodle parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Rottles are brown, black, white, red, gray, and blue. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colorsTheir fur can be single-layered, like Rottweilers, or double-layered, thick, and curly, like Poodles. They tend to be lower shedding dogs, but that doesn't mean they're hypoallergenic. A good brushing every other day should keep your Rottle's coat healthy.Although they have thicker fur, do not leave your Rottle out in extremely hot or cold temperatures. You may need to apply sunscreen to the ears, nose, and sensitive areas where there's less fur coverage in the summer month. Monitor your Rottle outside, and be sure not to leave them out alone.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Generally, the Rottle is considered a family friendly mixed breed dog. They can be affectionate in nature, but it's still important to teach children how to safely and respectfully play with your Rottle. If untrained, a Rottle could get defensive around new people, including other children.The Rottle tends to get along with other dogs, as well, so long as they are introduced in a slow and calm manner. Early socialization will help this go smoothly. It's best if they get used to other pets early. That said, Rottles are somewhat protective and may be better suited in a one-dog household.Still, many Rottles get along just fine with other dogs and cats, so it really comes down to training, socialization, and the luck of the draw.",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed specific rescue for Rottles because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Rottweiler or Poodle breed specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:Memphis Rottweiler RescueCarolina Poodle RescueYou can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!"
