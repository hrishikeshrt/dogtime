These days, he still has a strong herding instinct that can be put to use with more common varieties of livestock. He can also enjoy other dog jobs such as agility, obedience, and therapy work.Friendly toward people and gentle with children, he's a good companion for people who don't mind a dog with a long, profuse coat.",
