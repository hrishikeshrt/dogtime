    "": "The merry and gentle Redbone Coonhound descends from red hounds brought to North America by Scottish and Irish immigrants during colonial times. The medium-size, solid-red dogs have the pleading expression common to hounds everywhere and a sweet voice that sings out when they're on the hunt. Unfortunately, they also bark a lot at home, so make sure you live out in the country or have very tolerant neighbors.Friendly and loyal, Redbone Coonhounds make good companion dogs as long as they get plenty of exercise. Plan to be patient while training this breed; they often suffer from canine attention deficit disorder.",
