  "name": "Irish Red And White Setter",
  "intro": "The Irish Red and White Setter dog breed barely escaped extinction when most breeders began focusing on the all-red varieties. Now they\u2019re considered a separate breed from their Irish Setter cousins.\nEven though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Remember to adopt! Don\u2019t shop if you want to bring a dog home.\nAs gundogs, the Irish Red and White Setters are slow to train but eventually become loyal and reliable hunters. They can also be great family companions, though their high energy and exercise needs make them a poor choice for apartment dwellers or those who can\u2019t keep up with them physically. If you can provide them with plenty of activity for their body and brain, this may be the breed for you!\nSee below for complete list of dog breed traits and facts about Irish Red and White Setters!",
  "description": {
    "": "Early Irish Setters came in red or red and white, but eventually breeders began to focus only on the red varieties, and the red-and-white setters almost disappeared. They were saved from extinction, however, and now they're considered a separate breed from their Irish Setter cousins.As gundogs, they take their own sweet time in learning their duties, but eventually become loyal and reliable hunters. They display a strong zest for life and make great friends for kids who are big enough to stand up to their rambunctious play. Give them a home with lots of room to run, and be prepared to train them with patience and consistency.",
    "Size": "Males stand 24 to 26 inches at the shoulder; females, 22. 5 to 24 inches. Irish Red and White Setters generally weigh between 50 to 70 pounds.",
