  "description": {
    "Highlights": "Bossies are mixed breed dogs. They are not purebreds like their Boston Terrier and Australian Shepherd parents.The main colors of Bossies are black, red or brown, and white. Rarely solid they typically have two or three blended colors.They usually have short coats and are not considered to be a good choice for allergy sufferers. There are longer-coated Bossies, too. If they get their Aussie parent's coat, they may require more brushing.Bossies are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one to two hours of exercise per day. Boredom can lead to destructive behavior.These dogs are smart and can be quick learners, but they can also be stubborn and forget training just as quickly as they learn it. For an energetic, consistent owner, their loyalty will go far with positive reinforcement.Bossies are best suited for families with older children. The Bossie is from \"herding dog\" parentage, and if the Australian Shepherd parent DNA is strong, they may herd kids or other ppets. However, once they're properly trained, Bossies make wonderful companions for families with kids.",
    "History": "The Bossie mixed dog breed may have existed naturally over the years, but designer breeders started intentionally mixing Boston Terriers and Australian Shepherds in the late 1990s, likely in North America.Breeders wanted to mix the two parent breeds to minimize health issues that many pure breeds face. They continued to create Bossies as demand for the pups climbed. Even though the Bossie got its start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you.Check your local shelters, look up Bossie rescues, or check with breed-specific Australian Shepherd and Boston Terrier rescues, as they will often, take in and help to re-home these pups.Bossies are recognized by:ACHC = American Canine Hybrid ClubDRA = Dog Registry of America, Inc.",
    "Size": "As the Bossie is a relatively new mixed breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between Boston Terrier and Australian Shepherd parents, you can expect Bossies to be medium in size.Most weigh in at 25 to 40 pounds and range in height from 15 to 23 inches at the shoulder. However, many can be smaller or larger depending on which parent's genes are more dominant.",
    "Personality": "Bossie dogs did not get their name by accident. They can actually be very bossy. It's your job as their parent to make sure they know that you're the top dog. They're very friendly dogs and, with their high energy levels, enjoy outings and walks and all sorts of different activities.Some Bossies will have herding tendencies from their Australian Shepherd parent and may try to herd other pets and children. They may bark at another dog they don't know but are not known to be yappy.These dogs are smart and can be quick learners, but they can also be stubborn and forget training just as quickly as they learn it. For an energetic, consistent owner, their loyalty will go far with positive reinforcement.Bossies will love all members of the family, especially those, who want to take them for walks and outings. Bossies may be best suited to large families with lots of people who are willing to give them plenty of love and attention.",
    "Health": "The Bossie mixed breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Australian Shepherd and Boston Terrier also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Bossies suffer from include:Hip DysplasiaLegg-Calve-Perthes Disease",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Bossie's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Bossies are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one to two hours of exercise per day. Boredom can lead to destructive behavior.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Another concern when it comes to your Bossie's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, all breeds are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly. There are plenty of videos on YouTube, offering tutorials and tips. Teeth brushing is challenging, but necessary for your dogs overall well-being.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Bossie diet should be formulated for a medium-sized breed with high energy. They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their amount of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the Bossie's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Bossie's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Bossie coats are often a mix of their Boston Terrier and and Australian Shepherd parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Bossies are black, red or brown, and white. Rarely solid they typically have two or three blended colors.They usually have short coats, and not considered to be a good choice for allergy sufferers. There are longer-coated Bossies, too. If they get their Aussie parent's coat, they may require more brushing but would withstand extreme weather better. Luckily, both coats are fairly easy to groom. A good brushing per week should suffice, though it's best to consult your groomer on your individual Bossie.Shorter coated Bossies aren't particularly suited for extreme weather. You'll likely need a coat in the winter for your dog, and you may need to apply sunscreen to the ears, nose, and sensitive areas where there's less fur coverage in the summer months.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Bossies are best suited for families with older children. The Bossie is from \"herding dog\" parentage, and if the Australian Shepherd parent DNA is strong, they may consider kids part of their \"flock,\" so you'll need to teach your Bossie that chasing and nipping at kids to herd them isn't allowed. Once they learn this, Bossies make wonderful companions for families with kids.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while they're eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.They can get along with other pets too, though watch out for herding behavior. This may not go over too well, especially with cats.The best way to learn more about Bossies is to read about their Boston Terrier and Australian Shepherd parents!",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Bossies because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Boston Terrier or Australian Shepherd breed-specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:Australian Shepherd Rescue in MichiganBoston Terrier & Short Nose Rescue of OklahomaYou can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!"
