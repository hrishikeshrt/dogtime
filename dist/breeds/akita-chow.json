    "Highlights": "The Akita Chow is a mixed breed dog. They are not purebreds like their Akita or Chow Chow parents.The main colors of Akita Chows are silver, fawn, red, brown, black, and white. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of two colors.While this dog is not a top choice for allergy sufferers, their coat is easy to groom and may only require a brushing three to four times a week.The Akita Chow's energy levels may vary, but this dog will need a rigorous exercise schedule. 60 minutes of walking a day is a good starting point.When raised with children, Akita Chows can do well with them, but they're not known to be playful dogs and may not put up with rough and tumble play from a young child.The Akita Chow would most likely prefer to be an only pet so they can dominate their human parents' attention.Akita Chows are often described as intelligent and independent thinkers, which means you'll have your hands full with training. When well-trained and socialized, you could not ask for a better, more obedient dog.These dogs do not do well when they're left alone for long periods of time. They may get anxious and engage in destructive or unwanted behavior.",
    "History": "It is not known exactly where the Akita Chow originated, and at this point, no one is taking credit for them. There is a good chance that someone began mixing Akitas with Chows in the 1990's in Northern America when, many groups of people were creating new designer breed dogs. It's also possible that this mixed breed has existed naturally over the years.This mix's parent breeds, however, have longer and more documented histories. For example, the Akita Dog is a working dog breed that originated in the mountains of Northern Japan. They previously worked as fighting and hunting dogs, though their current duties include police and guard work.The mix's other parent, the Chow Chow, is one of the oldest living breeds, having originated from Mongolia and Northern China roughly 2,000 years ago and, depending who you ask, the breed may even be even 3,000 years old and hail from Arctic Asia.The Akita Chow is currently recognized by:Dog Registry of America (DRA)",
    "Size": "As the Akita Chow is a relatively new mixed breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between the Akita and Chow Chow, you can expect Akita Chow's to be large in size.Most weigh in at 88 to 145 pounds and range in height from 23 to 25 inches at the shoulder. However, many can be smaller or larger than average. Males tend to run larger than females.",
    "Personality": "When it comes to this mix's parent breeds, Akitas can be willful and cautious of strangers while Chow Chows are often described as aloof toward people they don't know. This parental genetic combination makes Akita Chows a perfect guard dogs and companions.Akita Chows are often described as intelligent and independent thinkers, which means you'll have your hands full with training. When well-trained and socialized, you could not ask for a better, more obedient dog.Don't expect kisses and cuddles. While not big on typical dog-like displays of affection, Akita Chows are possessive of their human, which also means they are loyal to a fault. Just make sure they do not establish dominance over you, which they may push the boundaries on.Like most dogs, the Akita Chow needs early socialization\u2014exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences\u2014when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Akita Chow puppy grows up to be a well-rounded Akita Chow dog.",
    "Health": "The Akita Chow breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Akita and Chow also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common problems Akita Chows suffer from include:EntropionProgressive Retinal AtrophyHip Dysplasia",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Akita Chow's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.One tough job when caring for any animal will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as many dogs are prone to dental issues. Your vet can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.Since the Akita is more active than a Chow Chow, your Akita Chow mix's energy levels may vary. Make no mistake though, this dog will need a rigorous exercise schedule for overall health and well being. 60 minutes of walking a day is a good starting point.If you find your dog dragging their bottom or \"scooting,\" they may need their anal glands expressed. You can do this yourself or let your vet or groomer handle it. It's one stinky job that may be better left to professionals.",
    "Feeding": "An Akita Chow diet should be formulated for a large-sized breed with high energy and exercise needs. Look for a high quality dog food for optimum nourishment. As with most dogs it's best to stick to a feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Twice a day feedings may be ideal.As with all dogs, the Akita Chow's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Akita Chow's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Akita Chow coats are often a mix of their Akita and Chow Chow parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Akita Chows are silver, fawn, red, brown, black, and white. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of two colors.The Akita Chow has a long, thick, straight, double coat and is a heavy shedding dog. While this dog is not a top choice for allergy sufferers, their coat is easy to groom and may only require a brushing three to four times a week.As far as extreme weather goes, the Akita Chow would not be a great choice for a hot climate. Their double coat would help to keep them warm in cold weather. It's important to remember this is an indoor dog and needs to live indoors.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "When raised with children, Akita Chows can do well with them, but they're not known to be playful dogs and may not put up with rough and tumble play from a young child. Akita Chows do best in families with older kids who understand how to interact with a dog.As with any dog, always teach children how to approach and touch your dog, and supervise all interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any mishandling from either party.Akitas are best kept as a solo pet while Chow Chows can get along with other dogs if they're raised with them from an early age. It's best to err on the side of caution with the Akita Chow mixed breed and not plan on getting them any fur siblings. They would most likely prefer to be an only pet so they can dominate their human parents' attention.Find out if this is the right dog for you by learning about their Akita and Chow Chow parents.",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Akita Chows because they are a mixed breed.
