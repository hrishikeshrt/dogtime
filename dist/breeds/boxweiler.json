    "Highlights": "Boxweilers are mixed breed dogs. They are not purebreds like their Boxer or Rottweiler parentsThe main colors of the Boxweiler coats are fawn, black, brindle, white, and brown.

They are not hypoallergenic dogs.Boxweilers need at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.The Boxweiler may prefer to be mostly around adults and older kids who know how to play gently.Boxweilers aren't naturally fond of other animals and may prefer to be the solo pet in the household.Boxweilers can be stubborn sometimes but are highly intelligent and can be easy to house train if you are energetic and consistent with their training. They can make great guardians or watchdogs of the household.",
    "History": "The Boxweiler is believed to have been bred sometime in the 1980s by crossing Boxers and Rottweilers together. Not much is known concerning this mixed breed's background. What we do know is that both the Boxer and Rottweiler breeds have great histories.The ancestors of modern Boxers were used for many tasks, from hunting to guarding and herding cattle. This breed served as messenger dogs in World War I, carrying supplies and acting as guard and attack dogs.Rottweilers' ancestors were also large dogs who drove cattle. Rotties were often used to pull carts and served as guard dogs. In fact, some people would put their coin purses around their Rottweilers' necks for safe keeping. They're still prized for their guard dog abilities today, and some have served in military and police work.Boxweilers are fairly likely to inherit many of the traits that have made their parent breeds so revered throughout history.The American Kennel Club (AKC) granted full recognition to the Boxer breed in 1904. The Rottweiler was inducted later in 1931.",
    "Size": "As the Boxweiler is a mixed breed, there are few standards when it comes to its size. That said, as a mix between Boxer and Rottweiler parents, you can expect the Boxweiler to be on the larger side.Most weigh in at 70 to 100 pounds and range in height from 21 to 27 inches at the shoulder. However, many can be smaller or larger than normal.",
    "Personality": "Boxweilers are very loving and loyal dogs with lively personalities. This usually means they love running around and playing games like fetch with their pet parents. Even with their high energy, they are also affectionate and love to cuddle inside the house with their human counterparts.These large pooches are working dogs and enjoy fulfilling that purpose in one way or another. That means they can make great guardians or watchdogs of the household. They will bark or alert their owners at the first sign of trouble. If you want a watchdog who will alert you to anyone who might approach your door, you can\u2019t do much better than the Boxweiler.These dogs do best with early training to curb any unwanted bad habits. They can be stubborn sometimes but are highly intelligent and can be easy to house train if you are energetic and consistent with their training.They also tend to latch on to one family member most of all, though they can get along with others in the house. The Boxweiler may be best suited for larger families with larger homes rather than small apartments.",
    "Health": "The Boxweiler mixed breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Boxer and the Rottweiler also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Boxweilers suffer from include:joint dysplasiaPanodemodectic mangeheart issuesbone cancerbloathypothyroidismeye problems",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Boxweiler's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Boxweilers are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long\u2014usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Boxweiler's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as many dogs are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Boxweiler diet should be formulated for a large breed with high energy. They have a tendency to gain weight if they're overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their number of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the Boxweiler\u2019s dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Boxweiler\u2019s diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs\u2014including weight, energy, and health\u2014to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Boxweiler coats are often a mix of their Boxer and Rottweiler parents' coats and colors. The main colors of the Boxweiler coats are fawn, black, brindle, white, and brown. Some of their coats are solid, and some of their coats have a mix of colors.These pups have short coats, though they are still moderate shedders. Make sure to brush them a couple times a week to prevent any matted hair or grooming issues. They are not hypoallergenic dogs.Boxweilers can handle cold or hot temperatures, but make sure to prepare accordingly depending on the extreme conditions of the area you are taking them to.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Because the Boxweiler is larger dog, they can easily handle the play of overly excited children. The Boxweiler may prefer to be mostly around adults and older kids who know how to play gently.That said, for children who learn early how to properly approach and play with a dog, the Boxweiler can make a great, active companion.When it comes to other pets, the Boxweiler can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. It's best if they get used to other pets early. However, Boxweilers aren't naturally fond of other animals and may prefer to be the solo pet in the household.Still, many Boxweilers get along just fine with other dogs and cats, so it really comes down to training, socialization, and the luck of the draw.",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed specific rescue for Boxweilers because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Boxer or Rottweiler breed specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:Green Acres Boxer RescueMemphis Rottweiler RescueYou can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!"
