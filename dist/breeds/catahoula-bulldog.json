They can act as guardians and protectors of young children--although when dealing with such a powerful dog, it's imperative that the breed is trained and socialized correctly from a very young age.You'll need to be able to commit to at least two long walks every day, ideally with the option of swimming or breaking into a run. This is not a a dog that will do well living in an apartment--and destructive behavior might occur due to boredom and restlessness.",
    "History": "The Catahoula Bulldog isn't one of the newest mixed breeds around. Common estimates suggest they've been on the scene for approximately 100 years. The breed has a record of being a very popular dog in the southern states of the USA, mainly due to their ability to hunt down and catch bears and hogs and herd cattle.Digging deeper into the dog's heritage, the Catahoula part of its name stems from a Native American word for \"clear water.\"The Catahoula Bulldog has become known as a designer dog breed, but many of them unfortunately end up in shelters.
