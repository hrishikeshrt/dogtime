    "Highlights": "Chi-Poos are mixed-breed dogs.

Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a blend of of colors.These dogs usually have medium length coats, and they're generally considered to be a good choice for allergy sufferers.

Apartment or large home, single person or big family, they will fit in anywhere.Chi-Poos aren't particularly suited for extreme weather. They handle heat better than cold, but you may need to apply doggy sunscreen in summer.Because the Chi-Poo is a small dog, they can be easily injured by overly excited children. Chi-Poos prefer to be mostly around adults or older kids who know how to play gently.",
    "History": "The Chi-Poo dog breed may have existed naturally over the years, but designer breeders started intentionally mixing Chihuahuas and Poodles in the US in the 1970s--right around they same time they started developing Cockapoos.Breeders wanted to mix the two parent breeds to create a low-maintenance, intelligent dog who's easy to train and independent. Mixing breeds can often minimize health issues, as well. They continued to create Chi-Poos as demand for the mixed breed pups climbed.Even though the Chi-Poo breed got its start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you.Check your local shelters, look up Chi-Poo rescues, or check with breed-specific Poodle or Chihuahua rescues, as they sometimes try to re-home mixes.While Chi-Poos are not recognized by the American Kennel Club, they are recognized by the American Canine Hybrid Club, the Designer Dogs Kennel Club, International Designer Canine Registry, and Designer Breed Registry.",
    "Size": "As the Chi-Poo is a relatively new breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between Chihuahua and Toy Poodle parents, you can expect Chi-Poos to be on the small side.Most weigh in at five to 20 pounds and range in height from five to 15 inches at the shoulder. That said, many can be smaller or larger.",
    "Personality": "Many Chi-Poo lovers describe their dogs' as playful, intelligent, and independent companions. Although they are the size of your average lap dog, their high energy levels mean they'd probably love following you around the house and getting involved in your daily routine.While both parent dogs, the Poodle and Chihuahua do not like being left alone, the Chi-poo is an anomaly. Most of them do just fine with working parents who have to leave the house for long periods.These pup are energetic and definitely would need to be with a person who is on-the-go or busy around the house. They enjoy watching you and would even enjoy participating in lots of activities, including walks and play sessions. Even though they are described as energetic, they don't require too much exercise. A few short walks per day should suffice with lots of potty breaks for their small bladders. Make sure to have an assortment of toys, as they will happily entertain themselves.They do well in single person families and large households with kids. You really can't go wrong with Chi-Poos. They will adapt to just about any environment.",
    "Health": "The Chi-Poo breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Chihuahua and Poodle also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Chi-Poo's suffer from include:Overactive tear glandsHypoglycemiaGlaucomaLuxating Patellas",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Chi-Poo's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Chi-Poos are prone to digestive issues, so small meals are recommended several times a day with high quality food.Due to genetics, they may be prone to overactive tear glands, which can cause tear stains near their eyes. Keeping a hanky or cloth nearby and dabbing them periodically can really minimize tear stains.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Chi-Poo's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as small breeds are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly. Dental chews can help significantly, as well.",
    "Feeding": "Chi-Poos are prone to digestive issues and hypoglycemia. An ideal diet would consist of high quality protein food formulated for small dogs.  Several small meals throughout the day is recommended.As with all dogs, the Chi-Poo's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Chi-Poo's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Chi-Poo coats are often a mix of their Poodle and Chihuahua parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Chi-Poos are; cream, brown, blue, brindle, silver, grey, fawn, white, and black. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a blend of of colors.They usually have medium length coats, and they're generally considered to be a good choice for allergy sufferers. There are longer-coated Chi-Poos, as well as shorter coated Chi-Poos. Their coats are fairly easy to groom. A good brushing once per week should suffice, but during shedding season, you may want to increase brushings to twice a week.Chi-Poos aren't particularly suited for extreme weather. However they can handle heat a little better than the cold. You may need to apply sunscreen to the ears, nose, and sensitive areas where there's less fur coverage in the summer months.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Because the Chi-Poo is a small dog, they can be easily injured by overly excited children. Chi-Poos prefer to be mostly around adults or older kids who know how to play gently. That said, for children who learn early how to properly approach and play with a small dog, the Chi-Poo can make a great, active companion. Always err on the side of caution, and never leave a small child unsupervised with any dog, under any circumstance.When it comes to other pets, Chi-Poos can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. It's best if they get used to other pets early. If the Chihuahua parent characteristics prevail, this little pup may want to be the leader of the pack in multiple dog households.Chi-Poos can acclimate to just about any household. Just remember early socialization can certainly help them to get along better with other animals.",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Chi-Poos because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Chihuahua or Poodle breed-specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:Chihuahua Rescue & TransportCarolina Poodle RescueYou can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!"
