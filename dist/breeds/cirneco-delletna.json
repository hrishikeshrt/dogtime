    "History": "The name \"Cirneco\" comes from a Greek word, \"Kyrenaikos,\" which means \"of Cyrene.\" The ancient Greek city of Cyrene was located near modern Shahhat, Libya.The second part of the breed's name, \"dell'Etna,\" comes from Mount Etna on the island of Sicily. Although the Cirneco dell'Etna looks a bit like the Ibizan Hound, the breed's ancestors likely hail from Sicily by way of Phoenician trader ships that sailed thousands of years ago. Descendants of those dogs have hunted small game, like rabbits and hares, on the island for millennia.This breed is old. In fact, coins made as long ago as 500 b.c. from Segesta in Sicily depict dogs that resemble the modern Cirneco dell'Etna. There's even an old legend that says a thousand of these dogs guarded a temple of Adranos, a fire god. The dogs had a divine ability to find and attack any thieves or nonbelievers who approached while keeping devout pilgrims to the temple safe and at peace.Before 1932, the breed was mostly unknown outside of their homeland of Sicily. That year, a veterinarian named Dr. Maurizio Migneco, who came to the island, wrote an article for an Italian hunting journal that covered the breed's declining numbers. Baroness Agata Patern\u00f3 Castello, an Italian aristocrat, was moved by the breed's plight and worked until her death to revive the breed.In 1939, Italy's national kennel club recognized the Cirneco dell'Etna, but it would be over seven decades before the American Kennel Club (AKC) granted full recognition to the breed in 2015.",
    "Size": "As the Cirneco dell'Etna is an ancient breed from the island of Sicily, there are some standards when it comes to their size. As a purebred dog, you can expect the Cirneco dell\u2019Etna to be on the medium side.Most weigh in at 17 to 26 pounds and range in height from 17 to 20 inches at the shoulder. That said, many can be smaller or larger than normal.",
    "Personality": "The Cirneco dell\u2019Etna is a very alert and gentle dog breed with an independent spirit. They are playful and love to be with people. Originally bred to help hunters catch rabbit and prey, they are now suited as companion dogs and love their human counterparts.They are highly intelligent and easy to train, especially when the trainer uses positive reinforcement and praise. Theses sleek pups have a high prey drive, so make sure to keep a tight hold on their leash, as they might give chase to a squirrel running by.As they are very independent dogs, it's suggested to make sure they are trained early as pups. They are friendly towards strangers and love to play with children. They can get along with other dogs and smaller pets only if they are socialized early.These pups are able to live in apartments in the city or large homes with yards as they are of medium size. They love to play catch and are also capable of cuddling inside with their human parents.",
    "Health": "The Cirneco dell'Etna is predisposed to some of the same conditions that most hunting breeds of their size might also face.

Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog\u2019s nails before they get too long\u2014usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor.

    "Feeding": "An ideal Cirneco dell\u2019Etna diet should be formulated for a medium-sized breed with high energy.

Limit the number of treats as well.As with all dogs, the Cirneco dell\u2019Etna\u2019s dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Cirneco dell\u2019Etna\u2019s diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs\u2014including weight, energy, and health\u2014to make a specific recommendation.",
