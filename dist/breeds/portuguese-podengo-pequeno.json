Their job was to keep the ships rodent free during their travels, which protected the food stores and prevented most of the sailors from getting vermin-borne diseases.The Portuguese Podengo Pequeno specifically entered the American Kennel Club Miscellaneous class in January 2011 and then the Hound class exactly two years later in January 2013.If you are interested in a Portuguese Podengo Pequeno, make sure to check your local shelters and breed-specific rescue groups in your area or online.
