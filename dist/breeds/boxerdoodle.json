After that, the Poodle became popular in France as a duck hunting dog.On the Boxer side, the breed began as both a working farm dog and fighting dog back in the 19th century. Their fighting tendencies have since been bred out of them, and they now make wonderful, loving companions for any family.The Boxerdoodle has become known as a designer dog breed, but many of them unfortunately end up in shelters. So consider contacting your local rescue groups and shelters if you're thinking about adding the Boxerdoodle to your home.",
    "Size": "The Boxerdoodle can be described as either a small, medium, or even large dog. As is always the case with newer mixed dog breeds, exact size standards might vary.Most weigh in at twelve to 70 pounds and range in height from ten to 25 inches. Female Boxerdoodles might be visibly smaller than their male counterparts.",
    "Personality": "When people talk about their Boxerdoodles, they usually begin by noting how social and friendly they are. They will instantly become part of a family and their playful nature means that they love to be around activity, which is why they can form great bonds with kids.If you're a person who likes to stay active and outdoors, your Boxerdoodle will almost always be in the mood to accompany you on hikes and treks.

    "Health": "Boxerdoodles are generally considered to be healthy dogs; although, the breed can be predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Boxer and Poodle face. As always, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your dog's vet.Some of the more common health problems Boxerdoodles suffer from include:BloatCardiomyopathyEntropion",
    "Care": "The Boxerdoodle is a dog with high energy and exercise needs. You'll want to aim for around an hour of exercise every day, and you'll want to make sure walks are carried out at a brisk pace. Ideally, outdoor time should also include the potential for swimming, fetch games, and even agility training. This is a smart dog, so keeping them challenged both mentally and physically is key to their welfare.Beyond exercise, Boxerdoodle owners need to pay very close attention to their dog's ears and eyes, cleaning and checking them both at least weekly. Due to the dog's exercise demands, you'll also want to schedule regular nail clippings--ask your vet for help and guidance if you're unsure about the best way to do this. After any extended outdoors sessions, it's also advisable to check the mixed breed's paw pads for any potential signs of damage.Check their ears, as well, for debris or pests, and clean them as recommended by your vet.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Boxerdoodle diet should be formulated for a small, medium, or large dog depending on the individual. However, in all cases, the breed has high energy.Boxerdoodles need to stick to a healthy diet, as overeating can cause weight gain and associated health problems, especially if adequate exercise isn't offered.As with all dogs, the Boxerdoodle's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Boxerdoodle's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",

When it comes to maintenance, you'll need to pick up a wire brush and commit to brushing the mixed breed's coat at least every second day. Otherwise, you could be looking at a visit to the vets or groomers to deal with mats that might develop.In general, the Boxerdoodle is considered to be an adaptable dog when it comes to climate. But due to the breed's range in size and coat length, you'll need to consider whether you live in a suitable place on a dog-by-dog basis.

During hotter months, make sure shade and fresh water are always available during outdoor play and activity sessions.",
