They were considered to have a strongly developed sense of smell which helped hunters with following scents and trails of their prey. It's from the German Bracken that the Bavarian Mountain Scent Hound was bred.Due to the mountainous regions in Germany where many hunters searched for game, the Hanoverian Scent hound was too big and heavy for the terrain. The Bavarian Mountain Scent Hound was lighter, more agile, and able to keep up with big game and prey that hunters were going after.The United Kennel Club (UKC) recognized the Bavarian Mountain Scent Hound breed in 1996, though it would be another 20 years until the American Kennel Club (AKC) inducted the breed into its Foundation Stock Service in 2016.The Bavarian Mountain Scent Hound Society of America formed a year later in 2017 to protect and promote dogs of this breed.Though they are a rare breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups.
