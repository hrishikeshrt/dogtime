    "History": "Australian Shepherd Pit Bull Mixes have likely existed naturally over the years, but designer breeders started intentionally mixing Australian Shepherd and Pit Bulls in the late 1990s, likely in North America.Breeders wanted to mix the two parent breeds to combine the trainable, loyal personality traits of a Pit Bull with the intelligence and coat of an Australian Shepherd. They continued to create Aussie Pits as demand for the mixed breed pups climbed.Even though the Australian Shepherd Pit Bull Mix breed got their start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you.Check your local shelters, look up Australian Shepherd Pit Bull Mix rescues, or check with breed specific Australian Shepherd or Pit Bull rescues, as they often take in mixed breed dogs and find homes for them.",
    "Size": "As the Australian Shepherd Pit Bull Mix is a relatively new breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between Australian Shepherd and Pit Bull parents, you can expect Aussie Pits to be on the medium-to-large side.Most weigh in between 30 to 85 pounds and measure 17 to 23 inches tall from the shoulder. However, some can be smaller or larger than average.",
    "Personality": "Lovers of Australian Shepherd Pit Bull Mixes describe the breed as incredibly loyal and highly alert. The Aussie Pit has loads of energy, and owners will have their hands full with a medium-to-large dog that needs plenty of play and walk time.The Australian Shepherd Pit Mix may also have a bit of a herding instinct or prey drive.

Curbing these unwanted habits, like heel-nipping or other prey drive instincts, can be done with early and consistent training.The Australian Shepherd Pit Bull Mix is also prone to bouts of bored destruction if left unattended for too long.

Early training is also crucial to nipping these destructive habits in the bud.The Aussie Pit loves to please their human, and they may stick to your side like glue.

    "Feeding": "An ideal Australian Shepherd Pit Bull Mix diet should be formulated for a medium-to-large sized breed with high energy.

Limit their amount of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the Australian Shepherd Pit Bull Mix's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years.

    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Australian Shepherd Pit Bull Mix coats are often a mix of their Pit Bull and Australian Shepherd parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Aussie Pits are blue merle, black, red merle, and cream. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colors.They usually have short double coats, which means they aren't necessarily allergy-friendly. There are longer-coated Aussie Pits too, although those are not as common. Luckily, both coats are very easy to groom. A good brushing per week will probably do it. If your Australian Shepherd Pit Bull Mix has a double coat, be prepared for them to blow their coats as the seasons change.Because they tend to have shorter coats, Aussie Pits aren't particularly suited for extreme weather. You may need a coat in the winter for your dog, and you may need to apply dog sunscreen to the ears, nose, and sensitive areas where there's less fur coverage in the summer months.",

That said, Aussie Pits tend to take up a lot of attention and energy, so they may prefer to be the solo pet in the household.Still, many Australian Shepherd Pit Bull Mixes get along just fine with other dogs and cats, so it really comes down to training, socialization, and the luck of the draw.",
