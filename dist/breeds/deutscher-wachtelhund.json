    "History": "In the late 1800s, German hunters wanted to recreate the Stoeberer, a versatile hunting breed that went as far back as the early 1700s. The Stoeberer were known to have tracking abilities similar to a Bloodhound.German hunters found remnants of the Stoeberer breed from Bavaria and bred them with other sporting Spaniels who were naturals at hunting. From there the Wachtelhund--pronounced Valk-tel-hund--or quail dog was born and officially recognized as its own pure breed in 1903.Today, the Deutscher Wachtelhunds in Germany are almost exclusively owned by professional hunters and foresters. There are some that were imported to Canada and fewer in the United States.Even though the Deutscher Wachtelhunds is somewhat of a rare breed, some have still ended up in shelters and rescues. Consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you.Check your local shelters, look up Deutscher Wachtelhunds rescues or even Spaniel rescues as they sometimes take in mixed breed dogs and find them forever homes.",

You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Deutscher Wachtelhund's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
