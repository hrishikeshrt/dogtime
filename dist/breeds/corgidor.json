    "Highlights": "Corgidors are mixed breed dogs. They are not purebreds like their Labrador or Corgi parents.The main colors of Corgidors are brown, black, red, and tan. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colors and fur types.Corgidors' short to medium coats protect them in cold weather. They usually require minimal grooming, though they are prone to shedding.Corgidors can adapt to apartment living with active owners but would really thrive in a big house with a yard and space to run.While not overly yappy, Corgidors make excellent watch dogs.Corgidors are very loving and patient with children of all ages.",
    "History": "The Corgidor is likely a much older breed than you would expect. Few details are known about the Cordigor's history, but some guess that Corgis and Labradors were intentionally crossbred for herding purposes starting in the early 1900s.While they are not recognized by the American Kennel Club, Corgidors have been recognized by the Dog Registry of America.Though Corgidors are a popular mixed dog breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you.Check your local shelters, look up Corgidor rescues, or check with breed-specific Corgi or Labrador Retriever rescues, as they sometimes take in mixed breed dogs and find homes for them.",
    "Size": "Being that their parent dogs, the Labrador Retriever and Corgi, are so different in height, the Corgidor size can vary, though they usually are right in the middle, branding them as a medium-sized dog.The males can run slightly larger in height and a few pounds more than the females. Generally, Corgidors are 40 to 55 pounds and twelve to 23 inches in height when fully grown, though some may be smaller or larger.",
    "Personality": "The Corgidors get their personalities straight from their parents. Corgis are protective and alert, while Labradors are friendly and lovable. Corgidors tend to make great family pets, as they are friendly toward strangers, but protective if their loved ones are threatened.The Corgidor would make a great watch dog, but also thrives on family outings. If you go on hikes, you'd better not leave this one behind. The Corgidor will require daily activities to release some energy.They would be able to adapt to apartment living with a rigorous exercise schedule and nearby dog parks, but would really thrive in a big house with a yard and space to run.While not overly yappy, they make an excellent watch dog. Corgidors are also very loving and patient with children of all ages.",
    "Health": "The Corgidor breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Corgi and Labrador Retriever also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Possible health issues that owners should watch for include:Eye problemsJoint dysplasiaEar infectionsBack problemsObesitySkin issues",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Corgidor's regular veterinary check-ups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Corgidors are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Corgidors have fast-growing nails. Trim them before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.A concern when it comes to your Corgidor's care will be maintaining their oral care. Your veterinarian can advise you on teeth care and YouTube should help with teeth brushing tips.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Corgidor diet should be formulated for a medium-sized breed with moderate-to high energy. They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day.As with all dogs, the Corgidor's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Corgidor's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Corgidor coats are often a mix of their Corgi and Labrador parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Corgidors are brown, black, red, and tan. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colors and fur types.They usually have short to medium coats with minimal grooming required. A good brushing per week will probably do, but expect excessive shedding. A robovac may be your new best friend.The Corgidor does better in cooler climates than warmer ones. They can overheat easily, so always have a fresh supply of water at the ready for these pups.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "The Corgidor is sturdy, yet gentle and makes an ideal pet for just about all ages and personality types. That said, as with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling, as well as roughhousing on the part of either party.When it comes to other pets, Corgidors can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. It's best if they get used to other pets early. Corgidors would do well with a second or third dog in their families to have constant companions and playmates.Corgis can be nippy with animals that are not family members, while Labs are typically very friendly with all dogs and people. Corgidors can be a perfect combination of the parents. Always be cautious introducing new dogs to each other. Nose to butt is a good sign. Eye to eye staring is not, and if that happens, the dogs should be separated immediately.",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Corgidors because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Corgi or Labrador Retriever breed-specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:CorgiAidLucky Lab Rescue & AdoptionYou can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!"
