    "History": "Labrastaffs are a relatively new mixed breed dog, so there's not too much accurate information floating around about their exact history. But the dog's parent breeds are another matter altogether.The Labrador Retriever originally hails from Canada, where it was bred for hunting and retrieving before changing roles and becoming renowned as a guide dog. The Labrador Retriever is widely believed to be one of the most popular dogs in the United States.The Staffordshire Bull Terrier has hunting roots. The're breed that was first used to bait bulls and fight in pits. Nowadays they make great family pets, and most of their aggression has been bred out of them.The Labrastaff has become known as a designer dog breed, but many of them unfortunately end up in shelters. So consider contacting your local rescue groups and shelters if you're thinking about adding the Labrastaff to your home.",
    "Size": "The Labrastaff is usually described as a medium-sized dog. Although, as is always the case with newer mixed dog breeds, exact size standards might vary.Most weigh in at 40 to 80 pounds and range in height from 17 to 24 inches. Female Labrastaffs might be visibly smaller than their male counterparts.",
    "Personality": "Tolerance is one of the Labrastaff's great virtues. This is especially so around young children--overly energetic play tactics usually won't antogonize the breed. True to the dog's social streak, they prefer to be around people rather than being left alone for long periods of time. So if you can offer a safe and fenced in outdoor space that you can also supervise, your kids and your Labrastaff will frolic away the afternoons very happily indeed.While Labrastaffs are usually great around humans, they can become wary of other dogs. For that reason, it's imperative that the breed is socialized and trained properly from day one. Aggressive tendencies might otherwise emerge.But as long as your Labrastaff knows their boundaries around people and other animals, you'll be looking at a super faithful and friendly companion and a great addition to any family who can commit to spending a lot of time around the dog.",
    "Health": "Labrastaffs are generally considered to be healthy dogs; although, the breed can be predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Labrador Retriever and Staffordshire Bull Terrier face. As always, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your dog's vet.Some of the more common health problems Labrastaffs suffer from include:BloatCataractsHip Dysplasia",
    "Care": "The Labrastaff is a dog that thrives in an outdoors arena. You'll want to aim to complete at least one hour of exercise every day. Ideally, walks will also offer the opportunity to turn into runs and swims; safe off-leash areas will also bring out the best in the dog.Due to the breed's service heritage, the Labrastaff will love to take on tasks and jobs, which help keep the canine mentally stimulated and satisfied.A Labrastaff maintenance routine will involve checking your dog's ears and looking for any signs of excessive dirt or odor. You'll also need to clean the dog's teeth and trim their nails on a regular basis. Ask your usual vet for advice about specific grooming techniques and considerations if you're new to the task of grooming a dog.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Labrastaff diet should be formulated for a medium-sized breed with high energy.Labrastaffs need to stick to a healthy diet, as overeating can cause weight gain and associated health problems, especially if adequate exercise isn't offered.As with all dogs, the Labrastaff's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Labrastaff's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "The most common colors of coat for a Labrastaff are black, brown, and brindle.The Labrastaff's coat veers towards the short and dense end of the spectrum. Its texture is straight. When it comes to grooming this mixed breed, you'll need to undertake daily brushing sessions to keep the dog's coat in its best and healthiest condition. Getting your Labrastaff used to being groomed from a young age is key--otherwise the breed might start to act stubborn around the brush!In general, the Labrastaff is a pretty adaptable dog when it comes to climate. But always make sure to provide a dog coat if the weather gets too frosty and your canine seems cold. Also, during hotter months, make sure shade and fresh water are always available during the outdoor play times the breed loves so much.",

Just be wary to leave the breed alone during feeding times--this is a dog that does not tolerate being busied while trying to chow down!If you have existing household pets, be sure to properly introduce your Labrastaff to them and set boundaries. This also applies to dealing with other dogs encountered during walks.Ultimately, early socialization really pays off with this mixed breed.
