  "description": {
    "Highlights": "The Mastador is a mixed breed dog. They are not purebreds like their Mastiff and Labrador Retriever parents.The main colors of Mastadors are brown, black, yellow and brindle. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colors.While Mastadors are fairly easy to groom, they are not a good choice for allergy sufferers.Mastadors love children. That said, they are large, active dogs and can accidentally knock a toddler down with a swipe of the tail. Always supervise play, even with a trained dog.",
    "History": "The Mastador dog breed may have existed naturally over the years, but designer breeders started intentionally mixing Mastiffs and Labradors possibly in the late 1990s in North America.Breeders wanted to mix the two parent breeds to minimize health problems that are associated with inbreeding of pure breeds and also to create the perfect family companion dog. They continued to create Mastadors as demand for the mixed breed pups climbed.Even though the Mastador breed got its start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you.Check your local shelters, look up Mastador rescues, or check with breed-specific Labrador and Mastiff rescues, as they often help to re-home mixed breed dogs.Mastadors are recognized by the following Clubs:American Canine Hybrid ClubDesigner Dogs Kennel ClubDog Registry of America, Inc.International Designer Canine RegistryDesigner Breed Registry",
    "Size": "Most Mastadors weigh in at 85 to 160 pounds and range in height from 28 to 36 inches at the shoulder. That said, some can be smaller or larger.Males tend to be larger than females.",
    "Personality": "Mastador have the reputation of being one of the most sweet-natured mixed breeds, and it's well deserved. The Mastador is a sensitive dog who can become shy, fearful, or aggressive if mishandled. Never treat your Mastador roughly or allow anyone else, including children, to do so.Mastadors are usually polite but aloof around normal strangers but will grow protective of their humans if anyone or anything seems threatening. Usually that's all they have to do, but they can escalate if the threat doesn't go away. Early training will help you encourage them to engage in this protective behavior only when it is appropriate and to back down when you give the command. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization.",
    "Health": "The Mastador breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Mastiff and Labrador also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Mastadors suffer from include:Elbow DysplasiaPulmonic StenosisCataractsRetinal DysplasiaCanine Hip DysplasiaObesityGastric Dilation Volvulus (GDV) or Bloat",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Mastador's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Labradors require more exercise than Mastiffs. The Mastador hybrid typically requires about one hour of rigorous exercise per day. Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Handle their paws frequently--dogs are touchy about their feet--and look inside their mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when they're an adult.Your main concern when it comes to your Mastador's care will be maintaining their oral health.Brush your Mastador's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Occasionally, Mastadors have impacted anal glands. This happens when the dog is unable to naturally empty the glands by defecating. If you notice your Mastador \"scooting\" or obsessively licking their anal area, take them to the veterinarian or a professional groomer to have the glands expressed. You can also learn to do this yourself.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Mastador diet should be formulated for a large breed with high energy. They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their amount of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the Mastador's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Mastador's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Mastador coats are often a mix of their Mastiff and Labrador parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Mastadors are brown, black, yellow and brindle. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colors. Their coats are pretty easy to groom and good brushing once a week should do. This is not an ideal dog for allergy sufferers.As far as extreme weather goes, they tolerate cold, better than warmer weather but not for long periods of time. They are an indoor dog. You may need to apply sunscreen to the ears, nose, and sensitive areas where there's less fur coverage in the summer months.Begin accustoming your Mastador to being brushed and examined when they're a puppy. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early and prepare them for handling during veterinary check ups.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Mastadors love children. That said, they are large, active dogs and can accidentally knock a toddler down with a swipe of the tail. They're best suited to homes with older children. Bear in mind as well that Mastadors are not ponies, and children cannot ride them. Your Mastador can be injured if children try to do so.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while they're sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.In general, Mastadors will tolerate other dogs and cats, especially if they've been raised with them. If you're adding a second adult Mastador to your family, you may want to consider getting one of the opposite sex to avoid any arguments over who's top dog.To learn more about the Mastador, read about their parent breeds, the Mastiff and Labrador Retriever.",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Mastadors because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Labrador Retriever or Mastiff breed-specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:Mastiffs To Mutts Rescue, Inc.Lucky Lab Rescue & AdoptionYou can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!"
