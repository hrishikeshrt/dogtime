    "History": "The German Shepherd Rottweiler Mix may have existed naturally over the years, but designer breeders started intentionally mixing Rottweilers and German Shepherd Dogs in the late 1990s, likely in North America. Breeders wanted to mix the two parent breeds, both of German descent, to combine their loyalty, strength, and intelligence. They continued to create German Shepherd Rottweiler Mixes as demand for the pups climbed.Even though the German Shepherd Rottweiler Mix breed got its start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you. Check your local shelters, look up German Shepherd Rottweiler Mix rescues, or check with breed specific Rottweiler or German Shepherd rescues, as they sometimes take in mixed breed dogs and find homes for them.",
    "Size": "As the German Shepherd Rottweiler Mix is a relatively new mixed breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a cross between German Shepherd Dog and Rottweiler parents, you can expect Rotties to be on the large side.Most weigh in at 75 to 115 pounds and range in height from 22 to 28 inches at the shoulder. That said, many can be smaller or larger than average.",
    "Personality": "Many German Shepherd Rottweiler Mix enthusiasts can attest that these dogs are nothing if not energetic. Both the German Shepherd and the Rottweiler were bred to be working dogs, and this mixed breed likes to stay active both physically and mentally.These pups can come with a lot of rambunctious energy, but with patient training and positive reinforcement, you can nip your German Shepherd Rottweiler Mix's excited jumping and other unwanted habits in the bud.Despite their large size, many German Shepherd Rottweiler Mixes tend to think that they're lap dogs. They love to snuggle with their humans, and they tend to stick closest to whoever their main caretaker is. They can sometimes become a little too protective of their humans if they feel threatened. Proper socialization can help keep your German Shepherd Rottweiler Mix's guarding tendencies from getting out of control.As big dogs, this mixed breed thrives in family homes, preferably with a yard or other area to run around. Still, a German Shepherd Rottweiler Mix can do just fine living in an urban setting, as long as their human is active and dedicated to exercising them frequently.
