Developed in Scotland, the Golden Retriever has always been renowned for their high intelligence and ability to take on agility and obedience-based tasks.When it comes to the Cocker Spaniel, this breed comes from Spain where they began as a hunting dog with a special expertise at tracking down and startling fowl.The Golden Cocker Retriever has become known as a designer dog breed, but many of them unfortunately end up in shelters. So consider contacting your local rescue groups and shelters if you're thinking about adding a Golden Cocker Retriever to your home.",

    "Health": "Golden Cocker Retrievers are generally considered to be healthy dogs; although, the breed can be predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Golden Retriever and Cocker Spaniel face. As always, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your dog's vet.Some of the more common health problems Golden Cocker Retrievers suffer from include:Hip DysplasiaHypothyroidismEntropion",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, it's important to keep up your Golden Cocker Retriever's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.When adopting a Golden Cocker Retriever, you'll need to be able to commit to providing at least an hour of outdoor walks and play sessions every day--and ideally this should be split up into two separate sessions. If you jog, bring the dog along!If you have access to a safe off-leash park, even better. Feel free to add swimming to the dog's routine. If you have a safe fenced-in yard, add some interactive toys to the environment and let the breed explore and investigate. In short, the Golden Cocker Retriever is a very high energy dog who often seems like they'll never get tired!As with any dog who loves the outdoors, check that their nails are trimmed and in good shape, and examine the paw pads for any signs of damage. Doing this every two weeks should suffice. Also, look at the dog's ears and pay attention to any signs of dirt building up or even infection.You'll also want to brush your dog's teeth, every day if possible. Ask your vet about any of the above maintenance procedures if you're unsure about how to carry them out safely.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Golden Cocker Retriever diet should be formulated for a medium-sized dog with high energy.Golden Cocker Retrievers need to stick to a healthy diet as overeating can cause weight gain and associated health problems, especially if adequate exercise isn't offered.As with all dogs, the Golden Cocker Retriever's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Golden Cocker Retriever's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "The Golden Cocker Retriever's coat usually comes in shades of either black or light brown.The coat is straight, medium in length, and usually described as being dense to the touch. The mixed breed does shed, so aim to brush the coat daily if possible, being on the lookout for any potential mats. Because of the dog's silky coat, you can also consider taking them along to a dog groomer every couple of months to keep it in tip top condition.The Golden Cocker Retriever does best in slightly warmer than usual weather. But as always, take steps to dress your Golden Cocker Retriever in a suitable dog coat if it seems extra cold outside, and always make sure there's adequate shade and fresh water around during the hotter months of the year.",

This is a gentle and playful mixed breed that will happily become play buddies with your children--just remember to make sure both parties are socialized correctly during the early days.In general, Golden Cocker Retrievers are fine around other household pets. But be sure the boundaries between the dog and existing household pets are laid down early.Ultimately, early socialization really pays off with this breed. Make sure to reward your Golden Cocker Retriever for good behavior and adhere to a proper training regimen when you bring them home to your family.",
