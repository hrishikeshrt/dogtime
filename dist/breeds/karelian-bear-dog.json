    "History": "The Karelian Bear Dog is a Spitz-type breed with an ancestry that goes way back. In fact, archaeological records suggest that dogs similar to the modern Karelian Bear Dog existed in northeastern Europe and Scandinavia as far back as Neolithic times, and they likely followed the first human settlers to the area thousands of years ago. People who lived in the region depended on successful hunts to eat and survive, and Karelian Bear Dogs were kept and bred to help with that task. They were most often used to hunt squirrel, hares, and other small game, but they were also capable of hunting large, aggressive animals, as well. Two Karelian Bear Dogs could easily tree a bear and bark at it until their human could catch up and bring the animal down. The breed needed to be hardy to withstand the climate and wildlife of the region.These dogs are still used to hunt elk and other large animals in Scandinavia today. Originally, Karelian Bear Dogs' coats came in many colors, including wolf gray, red, or black and tan, though modern breed standards have led to their coats being mostly black and white. Karelian Bear Dogs almost went extinct after World War II. In fact, all Karelian Bear Dogs alive today can trace their ancestry to 40 dogs that were saved during that time. Since then, the breed has grown more popular, and in addition to being one of the top ten most common breeds in Finland, Karelian Bear Dogs are also bred in North America and countries in Europe.The American Kennel Club does not fully recognize the Karelian Bear Dog, though it is included in their Foundation Stock Service which helps keep records of the breed's lineage and allows them to compete in some competitions.",

Dogs of this breed tend to weigh between 44 and 50 pounds, though individual Karelian Bear Dogs may be larger or smaller.",
    "Personality": "Karelian Bear Dogs are energetic, intelligent, and intense. They are prized for their natural hunting abilities, though this can make them aggressive toward other animals and dogs. Socialization and training need to begin early.

They do best with a large, fenced-in yard that will keep them secure and prevent them from getting lost while allowing them to run and burn off energy.As with many intelligent and energetic dogs, boredom is the enemy. A Karelian Bear Dog that isn't mentally and physically stimulated can act out in destructive ways. A tired dog is a happy dog, and that's especially true of this breed.

    "Care": "Karelian Bear Dogs tend to have fast-growing nails that must be trimmed or ground down often to avoid cracking, splitting, and breaking.

Keep up with regular vet visits to maintain good health for your Karelian Bear Dog.",

You should consult your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on what to feed your Karelian Bear Dog and the correct portion sizes. Their dietary needs will change as they grow from puppyhood to adulthood and senior age. Stay on top of these nutritional requirements.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Although ancestors of Karelian Bear Dogs had coats of wolf gray, red, or black and tan, modern breed standards dictate that their coat should be mostly black with white markings. Their black fur may be slightly tinted with brown highlights. Karelian Bear Dogs have an outer coat of straight, stiff hairs, as well as an undercoat that is soft and thick. Their coat protects them in all weather, though it is particularly suited to keep them warm through the Scandinavian winter.Karelian Bear Dogs are average shedders, and they shed more heavily twice a year as their seasonal coat blows out. Weekly brushing should be enough to loosen dead hairs and keep the shedding under control. An occasional bath or bathing as needed should be sufficient, as most Karelian Bear Dogs do not have the usual \"doggy odor.\"",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Karelian Bear Dogs are fairly good with children, especially members of their own household. They are playful dogs, though they can be intense and play rough. Always keep an eye on children and dogs during playtime, even if a dog is well trained and not aggressive. Instruct kids on how to treat pets gently and appropriately. The Karelian Bear Dog is not overly trusting of strangers, so friends and young playmates that visit must be introduced, and the resident pooch must have time to relax and space to get used to the new person. The Karelian Bear Dog may not be the best breed for children who are very young and inexperienced with dogs, as they may be accidentally knocked over or injured by an overly enthusiastic pup during play.When it comes to other pets and dogs, the Karelian Bear Dog can be downright aggressive. Socialization training must begin early if they are to overcome their natural tendency to fight with other animals. Even then, the Karelian Bear Dog may be best suited to a home where they can be the sole pet.",
    "Rescue Groups": "Though there are many breeders of Karelian Bear Dogs that occasionally help rescue dogs from shelters and place them in forever homes, there are few, if any, groups specifically dedicated to only rescuing Karelian Bear Dogs.
