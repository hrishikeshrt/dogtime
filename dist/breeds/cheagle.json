  "description": {
    "Highlights": "The Cheagle is a mixed breed dog. They are not purebreds like their Chihuahua or Beagle parents.Cheagles are prone to weight gain if they are overfed. Stick to an appropriate diet and feeding schedule.The main colors of Cheagles are combinations of brown, black, white, and cream. Sometimes their coats are solid, but usually a combination of colors.Breeders started intentionally mixing Chihuahuas and Beagles to make Cheagles in the late 1990s.Cheagles have high energy and prefer an active play session to being a lap dog.Cheagles tend to bark often, which makes them good watchdogs. However, early training can help curb unwanted barking tendencies.Because Cheagles tend to be small, they can be easily injured by children who play rough. They may prefer homes with older kids or children who have been taught how to handle small animals.",
    "History": "The Cheagle dog breed may have existed naturally over the years, but designer breeders started intentionally mixing Chihuahuas and Beagles in the late 1990s, likely in North America.Even though the Cheagle breed got its start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you.Check your local shelters, look up Cheagle rescues, or check with breed-specific Beagle or Chihuahua rescues, as they sometimes take in mixed breed dogs.The Cheagle has been recognized by:The Dog Registry of AmericaAmerican Canine Hybrid ClubInternational Canine Registry",
    "Size": "The Cheagle is a relatively new breed, so there are few standards when it comes to size. As a mix between Chihuahua and Beagle parents, you can expect Cheagles to be on the small side.Most weigh in at 20 to 30 pounds and range in height from nine to 14 inches at the shoulder. That said, many can be smaller or larger depending on which parents genes are more dominant.",
    "Personality": "Many Cheagle lovers describe these dogs' personalities as loyal and fun-loving. Although they are the size of your average lap dog, their high energy levels mean they'd probably prefer a game of fetch to a cuddle session.Some Cheagles may have a prey drive, though most seem to have lost the hunting tendencies of their Beagle parents. They do, however, love to bark. If you want a watchdog who will alert you to anyone at your door, you can't do much better than the Cheagle.They can be stubborn and difficult to train, but for a patient, consistent owner, their loyalty and desire to please will help training go a bit more smoothly. Treat rewards may also help them to be more agreeable.They also tend to latch on to one family member most of all, though they can get along with others in the house. Cheagles may be best suited to a one-person home or families with older children.",
    "Health": "The Cheagle breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Chihuahua and Beagle also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Cheagles suffer from include:Hip dysplaysiaObesityThyroid issues",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Cheagle's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Cheagles are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Cheagle's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as small breeds are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly and YouTube can help with teeth brushing and nail trimming tutorials.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Cheagle diet should be formulated for a small breed with high energy. They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day.As with all dogs, the Cheagle's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Cheagle's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Cheagle coats are often a mix of their Beagle and Chihuahua parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Cheagles are combinations of brown, black, white, and cream. Sometimes their coats are solid, but usually they're a combination of colors.They typically have short, shiny coats, and they're generally pretty easy to groom. Luckily, both parents' coats are very easy to groom. A good brushing per week will probably do. Baths should be sparse as they tend to get dry, flaky skin, and they need their natural oils for optimum radiance.Because they tend to have shorter coats, Cheagles aren't particularly suited for extreme weather. You'll likely need a coat in the winter for your dog, and you may need to apply sunscreen to the ears, nose, and sensitive areas where there's less fur coverage in the summer months.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Because the Cheagle is a small dog, they can be easily injured by overly excited children. Cheagles prefer to be mostly around adults or older kids who know how to play gently. The Cheagle can make a great, active companion.When it comes to other pets, Cheagles can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. It's best if they get used to other pets early.Always be cautious introducing new dogs to each other. Nose to butt is a good sign. Eye to eye staring is not good, and if that happens, the dogs should separated immediately.",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Cheagle because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Chihuahua or Beagle breed-specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:Chihuahua Rescue & Transport (CRT)Nor Cal Beagle RescueYou can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!"
