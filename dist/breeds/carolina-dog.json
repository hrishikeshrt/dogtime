  "intro": "Indigenous to the United States, the Carolina Dog is a rare, primitive dog breed and relatively new to domesticity. They are medium in size, agile, and independent; they\u2019re also known for being very clean dogs.\nThe Carolina Dog is also sometimes called the Yellow Dog, the American Dingo, the Dixie Dingo, and the Yaller. They were feral and lived in the Southeastern United States for hundreds of years, and they\u2019re still found in the wild in some parts of Georgia and South Carolina.\nCarolina Dogs are probably not going to be overly affectionate but will form close bonds with their humans. Show them strong leadership and let them know you\u2019re in charge when training. They may act reserved and wary of strangers, but they don\u2019t tend to behave aggressively.\nCanines of this breed are pack dogs through and through, and they\u2019d thrive in multi-dog and person homes, forming loving bonds with other dogs and humans alike. They have a high prey drive, so you must watch them closely around other small animals. They love big families and big homes with yards where they can run around. Carolina Dogs are incredibly loyal to their humans and sweet and playful with kids.\nDogTime recommends this dog bed to give a good night\u2019s sleep to your medium-sized Carolina Dog. You should also pick up this dog fetch toy to help burn off your pup\u2019s high energy!\nSee below for complete list of Carolina Dog breed facts and traits!",
