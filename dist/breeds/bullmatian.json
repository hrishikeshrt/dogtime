  "description": {
    "Highlights": "Bullmatians are mixed breed dogs. They are not purebreds like their Dalmatian or Bulldog parents.While Bullmatians are super loyal dogs, they can be prone to bouts of stubbornness. They need patient and authoritative training.The Bullmatian has a spotted coat. Although, unlike Dalmatians, the spots will not always be black--colors like brown, orange, fawn, red, and brindle are frequently seen.Bullmatians are relatively low maintenance when it comes to grooming, requiring coat brushings only about three times a week.In general, Bullmatians prefer a moderate climate. They don't have high tolerance for very hot and very cold environments, and you may need a doggy jacket in winter and sunscreen in the summer.Bullmatians tend to have high energy. They'll happily join you for a jog or run.",
    "History": "The Bullmatian is a pretty new hybrid dog breed that was first discovered in Afghanistan.When it comes to the mixed breed's parentage, the Bulldog originated in England during the 1500s. It was a dog originally bred to take part in bull baiting--although once the practice was outlawed, Bulldogs became coveted as companion dogs. The Dalmatian was also popular in England, commonly being used as firehouse dogs charged with keeping watch over the stations.The Bullmatian is a designer dog breed, but many of them unfortunately end up in shelters. So consider contacting your local rescue groups and shelters if you're thinking about adding the Bullmatian to your home.",
    "Size": "The Bullmatian is usually described as a medium-sized dog--although, as with all newer dog breeds, the exact size standards may vary.Most weigh in at 41 to 65 pounds and range in height from eleven to 24 inches.",
    "Personality": "Bullmatians are social dogs with a strong active streak. This mixed breed loves to follow their owners around, and despite sometimes demonstrating a wariness towards strangers, they will be happy to take center stage at family get-togethers.Exercise is a must for a Bullmatian's daily routine. These dogs are always up for a walk, and if you're a jogger, feel free to bring your Bullmatian along for the run! Ideally, a fenced in garden or yard will allow your Bullmatian to frolic outside on their own, too. Mental stimulation is also vital, so make sure to provide a range of interactive toys, and rotate them regularly.While Bullmatians are super loyal dogs, they can be prone to bouts of stubbornness. This is why it's imperative that they are trained and socialized correctly from an early age--and you might need to exercise a high degree of patience at first. But once your Bullmatian learns to trust and respect you, the breed proves to be a devoted dog and companion.",
    "Health": "Bullmatians are generally considered to be healthy dogs, although the breed can suffer from issues and ailments inherited from their parent breeds.Some of the more common health problems Bullmatians suffer from include:Entropion and eye issuesPatellar luxationDermatitisDeafness",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, it's important to keep up your Bullmatian's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Just like any other dog, Bullmatians can become obese due to overeating, so it is important to monitor food servings. Because the Bullmatian is such an active dog, it's vital to keep up proper exercise routines. Try and aim for at least one and preferably two hours of physical exercise every day.If possible, brush your Bullmatian's teeth a few times a week, and as often as every day if your vet recommends so. The breed's nails will also need to be trimmed, while weekly ear wipe sessions should be undertaken to lessen the risk of infection. Remember, a clean Bullmatian is a healthy Bullmatian!",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Bullmatian diet should be formulated for a medium-sized breed with high energy.As with all dogs, the Bullmatian's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Bullmatian's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "As you'd expect from a dog with Dalmatian heritage, the Bullmatian has a spotted coat. Although, unlike Dalmatians, the spots will not always be black--colors like brown, orange, fawn, red, and brindle are frequently seen.This breed's coat is short-haired and straight. Bullmatians are relatively low maintenance when it comes to grooming, requiring coat brushings only about three times a week.In general, Bullmatians prefer a moderate climate. They're not super great in very hot and very cold environments, so be on the lookout for signs of heat exhaustion throughout the summer, and during the winter months consider picking up a snappy dog coat for your Bullmatian to wear.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Bullmatians are great family dogs, and they are usually happy to form strong bonds with young children. But be sure to teach your kids how to respectfully interact with a dog and how to keep play sessions fun without becoming too boisterous. Supervision between kids and Bullmatians is key, especially during the early days together.In general, Bullmatians are good around other pets, although always exercise caution before introducing new pets to each other.As with all dogs, early socialization pays off, so make sure to reward your Bullmatian for good behavior and adhere to a proper training regimen when you bring them home. The payoff will be a dog who very quickly comes to consider you their best friend!",
