    "History": "The Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog is believed to be the oldest domesticated breed native to Australia, although the breed's origins aren't exactly confirmed. Researchers believe that British colonists crossbred their herding dogs with wild dingoes sometime during the 18th century. The sheepdog that the British had brought along could not tolerate the extreme heat, so breeders worked to create a breed that had the dingo's protective coat with their sheepdogs' herding skills.These ancestors led to both the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog. Selective breeding led to separate breeds, and the Stumpy almost became extinct in the 20th century.In 1988, the Australian National Kennel Council formed to preserve the breed. In 2005, the Stumpy was recognized by F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) and in 2010, the United Kennel Club (UKC) recognized the breed simply as the Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog. The American Kennel Club (AKC) currently includes the breed in their Foundation Stock Service, which is a step along the way to full breed recognition.",
