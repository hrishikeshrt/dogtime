    "History": "The Biewer Terrier originated in Hunstruck, Germany on January 20th, 1984 after two Yorkshire Terriers with recessive piebald genes were bred by Gertrud and Werner Biewer. Both Gertrud and Werner Biewer were passionate Yorkshire Terrier lovers, who raised and bred them for 20 years, and only stumbled upon the Biewer Terrier breed after noticing the recessive piebald gene their Yorkshire inherited.In Germany, the Biewer Terrier breed fell in popularity by the year 2000, and the number of breeders dropped significantly. However, the breed enjoyed renewed popularity once these dogs were brought to America. A few years later in 2014, the American Kennel Club (AKC) inducted the Biewer Terrier into their Foundation Stock Service. In 2021, the AKC recognized the Biewer Terrier as a full, pure breed in the Toy Group.If you are interested in this wonderful breed, consider adoption by checking your local shelters or breed-specific rescues because all dogs deserve a loving home.",

    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Biewer Terrier's veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine specific for your dog breed that will keep them healthy.The Biewer Terrier is a naturally active breed that requires regular daily exercise to work off their excess energy.

You can also choose to shorten their coat which would reduce the need for brushing.Their nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in an infection.Teeth should be brushed regularly. As a small breed, these dogs may be more prone to dental issues. Your vet can help you form a brushing routine and give you further instructions on dental care at home.",

Make sure to feed them high quality foods.As with all dogs, the Biewer Terrier's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Biewer Terrier's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "As the Biewer Terrier are descendants of the Yorkshire Terrier, their coats might be similar, but their coat colors will have differences. Biewer Terriers have a piebald colorization, meaning they have irregular patches of colors. Usually their coloring includes white or blueish-white patches over white fur on their chests, legs, and undersides. Their faces usually have black and tan coloring.These pups typically have long coats though you can also choose to shorten the coat to reduce the need for daily brushing.
