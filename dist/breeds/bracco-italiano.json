Paintings that depict dogs resembling today's Bracco Italiano date all the way back to the 4th and 5th centuries BC, and frescoes of dogs that look like this breed appear from Italy during the Renaissance in the 14th century. Some historians believe the Bracco Italiano was originally a cross between a Segugio Italiano and the Asiastic Mastiff.These hunting dogs were popular among the Italian noble families, as they were bred by the Medici and Gonzaga families. Their original job was to drive game into nets or flush birds and other prey from falconers. Later, when firearms were used by hunters, the Bracco was used to retrieve game.The population of the Bracco Italiano dwindled in the early 20th century. An Italian breeder named Ferdinando Delor de Ferrabouc revived the breed and founded the Societa Amitori Bracco Italiano. Today, the breed is popular in Europe and the United States, and can still be seen as hunting and working companions.In 2006, the United Kennel Club (UKC), recognized the Bracco Italiano as a purebred dog. A year later, The Bracco Italiano Club of America formed to encourage the American Kennel Club (AKC) to fully recognize the breed, as well. The AKC has included this breed in their Foundation Stock Service since 2001 and allowed them to compete in certain events since 2010, but so far, they have not granted the breed full recognition.",
