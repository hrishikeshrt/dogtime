By combining them, breeders hoped to create a dog who could be both a family pet and watchdog. They continued to create Akita Pit puppies as demand for the mixed breed increased.Even though the Akita Pit mixed breed got its start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you.Check your local shelters, look up Akita Pit rescues, or check with breed specific Pit Bull Terrier or Akita rescues, as they sometimes take in mixed breed dogs and find homes for them.",
    "Size": "As the Akita Pit is a relatively new mixed breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between Akita and American Pit Bull Terrier parents, you can expect Akita Pits to be on the medium to large side.Most weigh in between 30 and 70 pounds and range in height from 16 to 23 inches at the shoulder. However, many can be smaller or larger than average.",

Fortunately, as any Akita Pit owner will tell you, this mixed breed dog is eager to please. If you're able to consistently train your Akita Pit, you will end up with a loyal, loving, and eager-to-please pup.Some Akita Pits can become protective of their human family members and might try to guard them from strangers.

    "Health": "The Akita Pit breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Akita and American Pit Bull Terrier also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Akita Pit suffer from include:Elbow and hip dysplasiaProgressive retinal atrophyHeart diseases",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Akita Pit's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy. Akita Pits are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.

    "Feeding": "An ideal Akita Pit diet should be formulated for a medium- to large-sized breed with medium energy. This mixed breed has a tendency to gain weight if they're overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Be sure to limit their treats as well.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Akita Pits coats are often a mix of their American Pit Bull Terrier and Akita parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Akita Pits are cream, fawn, brown, black, blue, and brindle. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colors.They usually have short coats, but they do shed lightly year-round. This means they may not be allergy-friendly. Luckily, the Akita Pit coat is very easy to groom. A good brushing per week will probably do.Even though they have shorter coats, Akita Pits can fare well in chillier weather, thanks to their dense coats. Still, they should not be left outside in extreme cold temperatures, and there may be times where your Akita Pit needs a sweater or jacket. You may need to apply sunscreen to the ears, nose, and sensitive areas where there's less fur coverage in the summer months.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Akita Pits are incredibly loyal and loving towards their humans, including kids, which makes them a great choice as a family pet. Still, children should learn how to properly play with a medium- to large-sized dog properly before interacting with your Akita Pit. With proper introduction, an Akita Pit can be an incredible active companion for kids.When it comes to other pets, Akita Pits can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. It's best if they get used to other pets early. If introduced properly, they can become thick as thieves with other dogs. They may have a prey drive with smaller animals like cats but again, proper socialization can help deter unwanted habits.Many Akita Pits get along just fine with other dogs and cats, so it really comes down to training, socialization, and the luck of the draw.",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Akita Pits because they are a mixed breed.
