    "History": "Developed in the United States, the Jack Chi was created to fulfill the desire for a dog breed that makes a great companion and can fit in with the demands of modern living. Guess-timates suggest the Jack Chi was first developed a couple of decades ago--but there is little verified information about the mixed breed's origin.The history of the Jack Chi's parent breeds goes back much further. The Jack Russell Terrier was originally bred in the United Kingdom in the 1800s and used in hunting activities before becoming more of the family pet they are today. Chihuahuas go back even further, with Mexican artifacts from the 9th century depicting the breed.The Jack Chi is a designer dog breed, but many, unfortunately, end up in shelters. So contact your local rescue groups and shelters if you're thinking about adding the Jack Chi to your home. There's no need to purchase one from a breeder.",
    "Size": "The Jack Chi is usually considered a small dog, although sometimes the breed can spill over into the medium category. As a newer dog breed, exact size standards might vary, but with Jack Russell Terrier and Chihuahua heritage, you can generally expect a smaller canine.Most weigh in at eight to 18 pounds and range in height from twelve to 15 inches.",
    "Personality": "When you first meet a Jack Chi, you'll instantly be struck by just how fun and friendly this breed is. They love human companionship, whether with adults or children, and their natural energy reserves mean that they're sprightly, active, and always up for a play session.These are smart dogs too. In fact, you'll need to make sure that your Jack Chi knows that you're the boss of the house. To that end, the Jack Chi's spunky and outgoing nature means that it's exceptionally important that you train and socialize your dog properly and from the earliest possible age. Exercise and mental stimulation are key to keeping the Jack Chi happy and content.Despite sometimes having a reputation as a little know-it-all and being hard to train, if you socialize your Jack Chi correctly, you'll have an excellent companion, a loving and affectionate sidekick, and a cute-as-a-button canine to show off to your friends.",
    "Health": "Jack Chis are generally considered to be healthy dogs. However, this mixed breed can be susceptible to skin allergies that can result in excessive itching. As ever, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your dog's vet.Some of the more common health problems Jack Chis suffer from include:Patellar LuxationTracheal CollapseHeart ProblemsHypoglycemia",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, it's important to keep up your Jack Chi's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can also help you develop a regular care routine that will keep your dog healthy.This very energetic breed requires regular exercise to lessen the risk of obesity and also to channel their energy into positive play times, as opposed to possibly destructive behavior around the home. A couple of long walks every day are essential. Also, the breed's heritage means that they love to engage their hunting instincts, so hide and seek toys and activities are vital to keep them mentally satisfied.This breed requires regular ear cleanings so that dirt and debris don't accumulate. Checking their nails every couple of months should also be added to the routine. As both the Jack Russell Terrier and Chihuahua are prone to eye issues, it's important to schedule eye examinations. Dental check ups are also needed to pick up on any signs of periodontal disease early.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Jack Chi diet should be formulated for a small-sized breed with medium energy. It is important to make sure your Jack Chi doesn't overeat as, just like other small dogs, their bodies do not handle excess weight well.As with all dogs, the Jack Chi's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Jack Chi's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Black, choclate, fawn, golden, cream, and white are all popular Jack Chi coat colors, and the breed often comes in a mix of two colors. In a few cases, triple-colored Jack Chis have even been spotted!Jack Chis have dense, medium coats, and they have a straight texture. As a pretty low maintenance dog, the Jack Chi's coat can be brushed once a week. This will help keep their coat smooth. Occasional baths will suffice with this breed.Due to the Chihuahua side of the Jack Chi's parentage, the breed isn't particularly fond of cold weather. So feel free to pick up a snappy doggy jacket during the winter months.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "In general, Jack Chis and children are a great mix. The dogs are playful and smart and will happily enjoy joint play times with any little ones in your household. Just be sure to impress upon your child the correct way to handle and act around the dog, as they can become a little aggressive if they feel threatened due to mishandling.Jack Chis usually do fine with other animals and pets. Although, if the Jack Russell Terrier traits are strong in your particular Jack Chi, their hunting instincts might lead them to view domestic cats as prey. Be cautious when introducing new pets to each other.Ultimately, early socialization really pays off when you're adopting a Jack Chi, so make sure to reward your dog for good behavior and make sure to stick to a proper training regime when you bring the breed home.",
