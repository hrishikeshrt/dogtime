  "intro": "The Treeing Walker Coonhound dog breed has a short, clear bark and a passion for the hunt. Some are shy, some are confident, but they\u2019re all hounds \u2014 meaning, they need patient training and plenty of exercise.\nEven though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Remember to adopt! Don\u2019t shop if you want to bring a dog home.\nWith high energy and a habit of sounding off, these pups might not be a great choice for apartment dwellers. They need a good amount of exercise and room to roam. Those with big backyards can provide a more suitable home, so long as the yard is securely fenced. These dogs have hunting instincts and may choose to take off after critters that wander past. Although Treeing Walker Coonhounds may vary in personality traits, they all need plenty of physical activity and an experienced trainer to stay happy and well behaved.\nSee below for complete dog breed traits and facts about Treeing Walker Coonhounds!",
