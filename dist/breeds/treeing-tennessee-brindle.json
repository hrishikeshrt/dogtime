    "": "The Treeing Tennessee Brindle stands out from other trailing dogs for his brindle coat, strong scenting ability, and versatility. He sniffs out all kinds of game and sends it up a tree, holding it there until the hunter arrives.A descendant of the Old Brindle Cur dog, he comes from the piney woods of the Ozark Mountains, the deep hollows of the Appalachian Mountains, and everywhere in between. The breed's promoter was Rev. Earl Phillips, who gathered information about them in the 1960s. In 1967, the Treeing Tennessee Brindle Breeders Association was formed to preserve the brindle-colored cur dogs with their intelligent, courageous, and companionable temperaments.The TTB's primary characteristic is his brindle coat. He's smaller than the Plott, with a shorter ear and a different build. He's acclaimed for his good voice and sings out when he's on the trail. Despite the emphasis on the brindle coat in the name, when it comes to this breed, performance is paramount.",
    "Size": "Males stand 18 to 24 inches at the shoulder and females stand 16 to 22 inches. Weight is proportionate to height, ranging between 30 to 45 pounds.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "The short, smooth coat comes in brindle or black with brindle trim. Some dogs have white markings on the breast or feet."
