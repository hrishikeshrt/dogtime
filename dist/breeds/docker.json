  "intro": "The Docker is a mixed breed dog \u2014 a cross between the Dachshund and Cocker Spaniel dog breeds. They range in size from small to medium and enjoy lounging around with intervals of playtime. Fetch, hiking, or squirrel chasing would be ideal. These pups inherited some of the best qualities from both of their parents.\nDockers go by a few other names, including Doxie Spaniel and Spaniel Doxie. Despite their unfortunate status as a designer breed, you may find these mixed breed dogs in shelters and rescues, so remember to adopt! Don\u2019t shop!\nThese adorable pups make great family additions. The bigger the family, the better, because they don\u2019t like to be left alone for long stretches. If you want a sweet-natured dog who will also alert you to any potential dangers and enjoy paling around with you, the Docker may be a great choice.\nSee below for all Docker facts and mixed dog breed characteristics!",

    "Highlights": "Dockers are mixed breed dogs. They are not purebreds like their Dachshund or Cocker Spaniel parents.The main colors of Dockers are red, black, brown, or tan. They are usually a solid color but can have a second color mixed in.Their coats tend to be a combination of both parents' coats. Short and wiry from the Dachshund parent with a blend of the of Cocker Spaniel's soft and silky hair throughout.Dockers are not well suited for extreme weather. They may need doggy jackets in cold winters and doggy sunscreen in summer months.Dockers can bark a lot. They make great watchdogs. Early training can help curb unwanted barking tendencies.These dogs don't enjoy being left alone for long periods of time. They may get anxious and destructive without companionship during the day.",
    "History": "The Docker dog breed may have existed naturally over the years, but designer breeders started intentionally mixing Cocker Spaniels and Dachshunds in the late 1990s, likely in North America.While their parent dogs were originally bred to be hunting dogs, the Docker has a far different purpose, which is to be a lovable, furry family member.Even though Dockers got their start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you.Check your local shelters, look up Docker rescues, or check with breed-specific Dachshund or Cocker Spaniel rescues, as they sometimes take in mixed breed dogs and find homes for them.Dockers are not recognized as an official breed by most kennel clubs at this time.",
    "Size": "As the Docker is a relatively new breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between Cocker Spaniel and Dachshund parents, you can expect Dockers to be small to medium in size.Most weigh in at 20 to 30 pounds and range in height from nine to 15 inches at the shoulder. However, many can be smaller or larger.Females typically run slightly smaller than the males.",
    "Personality": "Many Docker lovers describe these dogs' personalities as loyal and affectionate. Since they come from a line of hunter parents, these sweet pooches will most likely have high prey drive and would enjoy chasing squirrels and birds around a yard.They come from a line of barky parents, too, and can be barky themselves. If you want a watchdog who will alert you to anyone who might approach your door, you can't do much better than the Docker.These dogs do best with early training to curb any unwanted barking habits. They can be stubborn and difficult to house train, but for a patient and consistent dog parent, their desire to please you will go a long way.If you are a single person who has to work all day, this is probably not the pup for you, as they may have destructive behavior when anxious or left alone for long stretches.",
    "Health": "The Docker mixed breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Cocker Spaniel and Dachshund also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Possible health concerns will depend on which parental traits are more dominant. Some of the more common health problems Dockers suffer from include:Intervertebral Disk DiseaseDiabetesUrinary Track IssuesAllergiesHypothyroidismHip Displasia",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Docker's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Dockers are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good 45 to 60 minute walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be loudly clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Docker's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as many smaller breeds are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.Also, check YouTube for teeth care and nail trimming tutorials.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Docker diet should be formulated for a small- to medium-sized breed with moderate to high energy levels. They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day.As with all dogs, the Docker dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Docker's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Docker coats are often a mix of their Dachshund and Cocker Spaniel parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Dockers are red, black, brown, or tan. They are usually a solid color but can have a second color mixed in.Their coats tend to be a combination of both parents' coats. Short and wiry from the Dachshund parent with a blend of the of Cocker Spaniel's soft and silky hair throughout. The blend typically will do well with a weekly brushing. But if they inherited more of the Spaniel parent's hair, daily brushing may be required. Your vet or groomer should be able to help with a schedule.Because they tend to have shorter coats, Docker's aren't particularly suited for extreme weather. When your dog is fully grown, you will have a better idea of coat care and if additional winter clothing is required in colder climates. You may also need to apply sunscreen to the ears, nose, and sensitive areas where there's less fur coverage in the summer months.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "The Docker is a sturdy yet sensitive breed and will most likely do well with child members of the family. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party.When it comes to other pets, Dockers can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. It's best if they get used to other pets early. If the Dachshund parent's personality prevails, the Docker may want to lead the pack in multi-dog homes.Always be cautious introducing new dogs to each other. Nose to butt is a good sign, as is tail wagging. If they are eye to eye, separate them immediately.",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Dockers because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Dachshund or Cocker Spaniel breed-specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:Dachshund Rescue of North America, Inc.Oldies But Goodies Cocker RescueYou can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!"
