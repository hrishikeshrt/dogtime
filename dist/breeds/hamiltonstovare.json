    "Highlights": "The Hamiltonstovare has mixed colors of tan on the head, around the ears, and on the legs. You might also spot black and white marks around the face, neck, and collar.They're fairly easy to groom due to their short coats. A good brushing per week will most likely do.Hamiltonstovares have a strong prey drive, as they were originally developed to hunt small game. Before you let them loose, you need to train your Hamiltonstovare to reliably return on your command, and you'll definitely need some way to enclose your yard, or they may wander.Hamiltonstovares have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.Because the Hamiltonstovare is an energetic dog, they might be too boisterous for toddlers or smaller children. Though they wouldn't harm children, it would be best if they were playing with older children or teenagers who can handle their energy.When it comes to other pets, the Hamiltonstovare has a strong prey drive and might not get along with hamsters, rabbits, or smaller animals.",
    "History": "Late in the 1800s, Count Adolf Hamilton, the man who founded the Swedish Kennel Club, developed the Hamiltonstovare breed. He aimed to create a strong, hardworking dog who would help people hunt small game, like foxes and rabbits. The dogs needed to handle the mountainous and untamed Swedish landscape.The Hamiltonstovare breed even worked their way into a Swedish folktale that tells the story of one of these pups journeying across the countryside with an elf and helping housewives in need.As scent hounds, Hamiltonstovares can help hunters either individually or with the assistance of a partner dog. They work to lead small game toward hunters. These dogs are hardworking and able to act independently.Today, Hamiltonstovare still help hunters in Sweden, but they're becoming more popular in other countries, including the United States. There is even a Hamiltonstovare Club of America.The United Kennel Club (UKC) recognized the Hamiltonstovare in 2006. The American Kennel Club (AKC) has admitted the breed into its Foundation Stock Service, the final step before full recognition.",
    "Size": "As the Hamiltonstovare is a relatively old breed, there are some standards when it comes to size. Generally, you can expect the Hamiltonstovare to be on the medium side.Most weigh in at 40 to 75 pounds and range in height from 19 to 24 inches at the shoulder. That said, many can be smaller or larger than normal.",
    "Personality": "The Hamiltonstovare is beautiful pup who loves the outdoors. They're a medium-sized pooch with high energy levels, which means they love to go out and play with their human parents. They're also affectionate and can stay indoors and cuddle with you on the sofa.Hamiltonstovares have a strong prey drive, as they were originally developed to hunt small game. They love open, rural areas and will follow a scent for several miles. Before you let them loose, you need to train your Hamiltonstovare to reliably return on your command, and you'll definitely need some way to enclose your yard, or they may wander.These dogs are not known for being \"yappy,\" but will certainly bark if they notice anything suspicious in their surroundings.Because they have a strong prey drive and can, at times, be stubborn, you'll need to be energetic and consistent with training to curb any unwanted behaviors.Hamiltonstovares love their human families and are only able to be by themselves for short amounts of time before feeling lonely. They're a great dogs for households of all sizes but are best suited for homes with a yard.",
    "Health": "The Hamiltonstovare is predisposed to some of the same conditions that Harriers and English Foxhounds also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems the Hamiltonstovare suffers from include:ear infectionship dysplasiaelbow dysplasiabloatepilepsy",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Hamiltonstovare's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.The Hamiltonstovare are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Hamiltonstovare's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as many dogs are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Hamiltonstovare diet should be formulated for a medium sized breed with high energy. They have a tendency to gain weight if they're overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit the number of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the Hamiltonstovare's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Hamiltonstovare's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs\u2014including weight, energy, and health\u2014to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "The Hamiltonstovare has mixed colors of tan on the head, around the ears, and on the legs. You might also spot black and white marks around the face, neck, and collar.The Hamiltonstovare has a typical hound coat, which is short and harsh. The hair on this pup, especially in and around the area of the head and legs, is more smooth. The hair on the back of the thighs and under the tail is noticeably longer. They're fairly easy to groom due to their short coats. A good brushing per week will most likely do.Because they have shorter coats, the Hamiltonstovare isn't particulary suited for extreme weather so make sure you prepare accordingly if you bring them somewhere that has a very hot or very cold climate.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Because the Hamiltonstovare is an energetic dog, they might be too boisterous for toddlers or smaller children. Though they wouldn't harm children, it would be best if they were playing with older children or teenagers who can handle their energy. That said, for children who learn early how to properly approach and play with an energetic dog, the Hamiltonstovare can make a great and active companion.When it comes to other pets, the Hamiltonstovare has a strong prey drive and might not get along with hamsters, rabbits, or smaller animals. However, if they are introduced slowly and calmly, they might learn to get along, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. It\u2019s best if they get used to other pets early.Still, many Hamiltonstovares get along just fine with other dogs and cats, so it really comes down to training, socialization, and the luck of the draw.",
    "Rescue Groups": "Because the Hamiltonstovare is a somewhat rare breed outside of Sweden, it may be difficult to find a breed specific rescue. However, you can always check with your local shelter, and you may want to try a rescue that caters to all types of dogs.
