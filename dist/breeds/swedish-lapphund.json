  "name": "Swedish Lapphund",
  "intro": "The Swedish Lappund, also called the Swedish Lappie or just Lappie by enthusiasts, is a member of the Spitz family along with Siberian Huskies, Akitas, and Alaskan Malamutes.\nThe Lapphund is named after the Lapland in the northernmost parts of Sweden, Finland, and Norway, and they\u2019re the national dog of Sweden. These dogs originally worked as herding and guard dogs for reindeer and are rumored to be the favorite canines of Santa Claus.\nAlthough these are purebred dogs, you may still find them in shelters and rescues. Remember to adopt! Don\u2019t shop if this is the breed for you.\nThis is a highly social dog who loves everyone. If you pass one on the street, chances are they\u2019ll make your acquaintance.\nHighly alert and playful, this would be an ideal dog to have in just about any family. Swedish Lappunds love to hike, run, and play when they are outside. However, they also have a \u201cchill switch\u201d when they\u2019re indoors and can relax with the rest of the family. A house with a big yard is ideal, but don\u2019t leave them alone outside for long periods of time, or your pup will get very barky and annoy your neighbors. These dogs should live indoors so they can be with their people.\nSee below for complete list of dog breed traits and facts about Swedish Lappunds!",

Long ago they were virtually the exact same dog, but over time have developed changes. The Finnish is slightly smaller than the Swedish Lappund. They also have variations as far as coat color goes as well.In the 1950s, they were near extinction, and thanks to a few dedicated Lappie lovers, the numbers have climbed ever so slightly.
