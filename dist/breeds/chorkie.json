    "Highlights": "Chorkies are mixed breed dogs. They are not purebreds like their Chihuahua or Yorkshire Terrier parents.The main colors of Chorkies are brown, white, silver, blue, and black. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix and blend of colors.Chorkies tend to be hypoallergenic with a low shed coat; though, it's tough to say for sure. If your pup gets more Chihuahua in them, they may shed a bit more.Since the Chorkie is a small dog, they can be easily injured. Chorkies tend to do better around adults or older kids who know how to play with them gently.Like both parent dogs, the Chorkie may suffer from separation anxiety if left alone for long periods of time.They don't require too much exercise. A few short walks per day should suffice with lots of potty breaks for their small bladders.Chorkies usually get along well with other pets. They may also enjoy being the sole pet of the house, as long as they are not left alone for long periods of time.",
    "History": "While the Chihuahua breed originated in Mexico, Yorkshire Terriers come all the way from jolly old England. But the Chorkie mixed dog breed's roots are much closer to home and most likely from right here, in the United States. While they may have existed naturally over the years, it wasn't until the early 1990s that designer breeders started intentionally mixing Chihuahuas and Yorkies, creating the adorable, lovable Chorkie.Once other designer dogs started to pop up, breeders likely decided to mix the two parent breeds to produce a small, adorable companion dog. They continued to produce Chorkies as demand for the pup grew.Even though the Chorkie got their start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the mixed breed for you.Check your local shelters, look up Chorkie rescues, or check with breed specific Yorkshire Terrier or Chihuahua rescues, as they sometimes help to re-home mixed breeds.Chorkies are recognized by the following clubs:American Canine Hybrid ClubThe Designer Dogs Kennel ClubThe International Designer Canine RegistryDog Registry of AmericaThe Designer Breed Registry",
    "Size": "As the Chorkie is a relatively new mixed breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between Chihuahua and Yorkie parents, it's safe to assume your Chorkie will be an itty bitty.Most weigh in at eight to 15 pounds and range in height from six to nine inches at the shoulder. That said, some can be smaller or larger than average.",
    "Personality": "Many Chorkie lovers describe their dogs as outgoing, fun, silly, and extremely loyal companions--so much so that they may exhibit aggression with people they aren't familiar with. Keep them on leashes at all times in public places.Like both parent dogs, the Chorkie may suffer from separation anxiety if left alone for long periods of time. Having multiple pets in the home can help with this.These pup are energetic and definitely would need to be with a person who is on-the-go or busy around the house. They enjoy watching you and would love to participate in lots of activities, including walks and play sessions and even watching you clean or fix something around the house.Even though they are described as energetic, they don't require too much exercise. A few short walks per day should suffice with lots of potty breaks for their small bladders.They do well in single person families and large households with kids. However, if you are in a single person household and work long hours, you may want to consider a different kind of dog.",
    "Health": "The Chorkie mixed breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Chihuahua and Yorkshire Terrier also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Chorkie's suffer from include:Skin Problems AllergiesPatellar LuxationHypothyroidism",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Chorkie's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Anal gland expression is also typically needed with smaller breeds. If you find your dog \"scooting\" or dragging their bottom on the ground, they may require having their anal glands expressed. You can either do this yourself, or request this during a grooming appointment. Sometimes groomers do it automatically, though not always. Mention it beforehand so this unpleasant task doesn't get skipped.The Chorkie is prone to overactive tear glands, which can cause tear stains near their eyes. Keeping a clean hanky or cloth nearby and dabbing them periodically can really minimize tear stains.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Chorkie's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as small breeds are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly. Dental chews can help significantly, as well.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Chorkie diet should be formulated for a small, active breed. They can gain weight if they're overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit the amount of treats you give your Chorkie, as well.A high quality dog food is recommended for this fancy breed. They need a good source of protein, and cheap \"filler\" dog food is not recommended for any breed.As with all dogs, the Chorkie's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Chorkie's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Chorkie coats are often a mix of their Yorkshire Terrier and Chihuahua parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Chorkies are brown, white, silver, blue, and black. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix and blend of colors.Chorkies usually have a light colored, silky, medium length coat with distinctive eyebrows. While Yorkies are hypoallergenic, Chihuahuas are not. Chorkies tend to be hypoallergenic with a low shed coat, though it's tough to say for sure. If your pup gets more Chi in them, they may shed a bit more.While the Chorkie has a medium to long coat, they do not fair well in extreme cold due to their tiny stature. They can handle some heat--nothing extreme. It goes without saying, they should always have easy access to clean water.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Since the Chorkie is a small dog, they can be easily injured. Chorkies tend to do better around adults or older kids who know how to play with them gently and approach them in a calm manner. That said, for children who learn early how to properly approach and play with a small dog, the Chorkie can make a great, addition to your family.When it comes to other animals in the household, Chorkies usually get along well with other pets. When in public keep your pup on a leash, Chorkies may exhibit signs of dominance around dogs they are not familiar with. Watch out and exercise caution.Chorkies love lots of attention and affection, and they may also enjoy being the sole pet of the house, as long as they are not left alone for long periods of time.To learn more about the Chorkie, check out their parent breeds, the Yorkshire Terrier and Chihuahua.",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed specific rescue for Chorkies because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Chihuahua or Yorkshire Terrier breed specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:Chihuahua Rescue & TransportSave A Yorkie RescueYou can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!"
