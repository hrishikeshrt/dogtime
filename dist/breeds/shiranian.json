  "intro": "The Shiranian is a mixed breed dog \u2014 a cross between the Shih Tzu and Pomeranian breeds. Small, adorable, and loyal, these pups inherited some of the best qualities from both of their parents.\nShiranians are also called Pomshi, Shih-Pom, Shih-A-Pom and Pom-Tzu. Despite their unfortunate status as a designer breed, you can find these mixed pups in shelters and rescues, so adopt! Don\u2019t shop!\nShiranians make great companion animals for just about anyone, but a retired senior would most likely be an ideal match. These dogs love humans who pamper and dote on them. They\u2019re pretty versatile and can thrive in almost any environment \u2014 family home, apartment, or small country house.\nSingle person or big family, just make sure your Shiranian gets lots of love and attention. They should never be kept outside and will require regular vet check ups, dental cleanings, and grooming sessions. Frequent potty breaks also help with their small bladders.\nSee below for all Shiranian facts and mixed dog breed traits!",

    "Highlights": "Shiranians are mixed breed dogs. They are not purebreds like their Shih Tzu or Pomeranian parents.The main colors of Shiranians are brown, black, sable, brindle, red, and white. Sometimes their coats are solid, though often they have a mix of their parents' patterns and colors.They usually have long coats, and they're generally considered to be a good choice for allergy sufferers. Their coats require daily brushing as well as monthly grooming.Because the Shiranian is a small dog, they can be easily injured by overly excited children. Shiranians prefer to be mostly around adults or older kids who know how to play gently.Most Shiranians are described as friendly and playful. They are the size of your average lap dog, and their moderate energy level means they'd probably enjoy a good nap as much as a play session.Shiranians are prone to weight gain. These pups need a few short walks per day and plenty of potty breaks. You should also brush their teeth daily, as small breeds are prone to dental issues.",
    "History": "The Shiranian dog breed may have existed naturally over the years, but designer breeders started intentionally mixing Shih Tzus and Pomeranians in the late 1990s, likely in North America.Breeders wanted to mix the two parent breeds to eliminate inbreeding and health issues that are common in purebreds. They continued to create Shiranians as demand for the mixed breed pups climbed.Even though the Shiranian mixed breed got their start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you.Check your local shelters, look up Shiranian rescues, or check with breed-specific Shih Tzu and Pomeranian rescues, as they sometimes help to re-home mixed breeds.Shiranians are recognized by:American Canine Hybrid ClubDesigner Dogs Kennel ClubInternational Designer Canine RegistryDesigner Breed RegistryDog Registry Of America Inc.",
    "Size": "As a mix between Shih Tzu and Pomeranian parents, you can expect Shiranians to be on the small side.Most Shiranians weigh in at four to 16 pounds and range in height from seven to twelve inches at the shoulder. That said, some can be smaller or larger.",
    "Personality": "Most Shiranians are described as friendly and playful. They are the size of your average lap dog, and their moderate energy level means they'd probably enjoy a good nap as much as a play session.While Shiranians enjoy a good siesta, they also enjoy walks and thrive on playtime. They may not be eager to learn a new trick but these lively pups do enjoy interaction and attention.The Shiranian will inherit characteristics from both parent breeds. Their personalities can vary but typically will fall in the middle of parental traits. For a good understanding of them, you should read all about their Shih Tzu and  Pomeranian parents. Combining these two breeds can create an ideal companion pup.Shih Tzus can be stubborn, but what they lack in trainability, they make up for in personality ten fold. They are incredibly friendly, attentive, and cute, while Pomeranians are intelligent, trainable, and active.Training and socialization should be established early on. Consistency and positive reinforcement are the ways to go with Shiranians.",
    "Health": "The Shiranian mixed breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Shih Tzu and Pomeranian also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Shiranians suffer from include:CataractsHypoglycemiaAllergiesHypothyroidism",
    "Care": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Shiranian's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Shiranians are prone to weight gain, and they have moderate energy levels. These pups need a few short walks per day and plenty of potty breaks.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. If your dog develops a pungent aroma, they may be suffering from an ear infection, which are common in this mixed breed. They may require a trip to the vet. Also, trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Shiranian's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as small breeds are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.",
    "Feeding": "An ideal Shiranian diet should be formulated for a small breed with moderate energy. They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their amount of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the Shiranian's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Shiranian's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.",
    "Coat Color And Grooming": "Shiranian coats are often a mix of their Shih Tzu and Pomeranian parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Shiranians are brown, black, sable, brindle, red, and white. Sometimes their coats are solid, though often they have a mix of their parents' patterns and colors.They usually have long coats, and they're generally considered to be a good choice for allergy sufferers. Their coats require daily brushing as well as monthly grooming. Baths should strictly be 'as needed' as they can strip the coat of its natural oils.These pups hail from royalty and aren't particularly suited for extreme weather. You'll likely need a coat in the winter for your dog, and you may need to apply sunscreen to the ears, nose, and sensitive areas where there's less fur coverage in the summer months.",
    "Children And Other Pets": "Because the Shiranian is a small dog, they can be easily injured by overly excited children. Shiranians prefer to be mostly around adults or older kids who know how to play gently. That said, for children who learn early how to properly approach and play with a small dog, the Shiranian can make a great companion.When it comes to other pets, Shiranians can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. It's best if they get used to other pets early. These pups do not like being left alone, so multi-pet homes may be ideal.",
    "Rescue Groups": "It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Shiranians because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Shih Tzu or Pomeranian breed-specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:PAWSITIVELY POM RESCUEShih Tzus & FurbabiesYou can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!"
