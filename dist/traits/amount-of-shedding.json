  "short": "Dog Breeds That Shed A Lot",
  "description": "If you're going to share your home with a dog, you'll need to deal with some level of dog hair on your clothes and in your house. However, shedding does vary greatly among the breeds. Some dogs shed year-round, some \"blow\" seasonally, some do both, and some shed hardly at all. If you're a neatnik, you'll need to either pick a low-shedding breed or relax your standards. To help keep your home a little cleaner, you can find a great de-shedding tool here!\nDogTime participates in the Chewy affiliate program to earn fees for linking to products on Chewy.com.",
