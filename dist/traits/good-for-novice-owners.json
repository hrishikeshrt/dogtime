  "description": "Some dogs are simply easier than others; they take to training better and are fairly easygoing. They're also resilient enough to bounce back from your mistakes or inconsistencies.\nDogs who are highly sensitive, independent thinking, or assertive may be harder for a first-time dog parent to manage. You'll get your best match if you take your dog-owning experience into account as you choose your new pooch.\nIf you're new to dog parenting, take a look at 101 Dog Tricks and read up on how to train your dog!\nYou may also want to consider adopting a senior dog, as they tend to be less demanding of your time and energy. You can keep your senior dog active well into old age by providing them with joint supplements to fight the symptoms of arthritis. Adding Glyde Mobility Chews to their routine can help their joints stay healthy.",
